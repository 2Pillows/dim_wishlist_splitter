// Midnight Coup (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors (which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors), One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives.

The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight.

Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. Only if you don't already have a scout rifle with the pairing, the Shoot-to-Loot and Explosive Payload trait perk combination let you pick up ammo and power orbs over a wider area from distance, as it includes the small AoE effect, as well as boosting damage and flinch. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

The Recluse is back and with even better range than the original. As a lightweight frame, you'll get the +20 mobility and +6.25% speed bonus to start. Add in a little extra stability in the barrel perk for easier control, and your preference of combat effect mag perk. Use the first trait perk to help with reloads, like Threat Detector, Enlightened Action or Feeding Frenzy, and then look for second column damage perks such as Surrounded (which will be enhanceable in Final Shape for +47% damage), or Desperate Measures for up to +30% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod), and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses.

Either Field Prep or Cascade Point and Deconstruct together make this a great DPS choice. Either just take advantage of two extra reserve ammo and faster reload and handling from Field Prep, or proc Cascade Point with a couple of sniper crits and to proc the higher fire rate, while Deconstruct with Sticky Grenades pulls bonus ammo out of the air on every second, rather than every third, hit because of the delay before the explosive damage.

// Falling Guillotine (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge), Swordmaster's Guard, (Frenzy, Chain Reaction), (Surrounded, Sword Logic, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Falling Guillotine is a decent, legendary choice for add clearing, particularly now that the BRAVE version can roll with two damage perks. As usual, look for a blade perk that boosts reserves, and then Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk for a bit of everything useful. In the first trait column, Frenzy provides the largest passive damage bonus of +15%, or there's the option of Chain Reaction (even if the combatant damage scaling means it's not as much fun as other weapon types). In the second trait column, Surrounded provides +35% damage (+42% when enhanced) when procced - which should be a lot if you're clearing adds, but there's also Desperate Measures and Sword Logic, which boost damage on kills, so you can chew through beefier adds too. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Falling Guillotine is a decent, legendary choice for add clearing, particularly now that the BRAVE version can roll with two damage perks. As usual, look for a blade perk that boosts reserves, and then Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk for a bit of everything useful. In the trait columns, for void fragment synergy, Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds grants any easy void overshield - handy for CQC work - on kills of adds made volatile on kills. If you're not so worried about the overshield, Chain Reaction can help spread Destabilizing Rounds volatility further through the death explosions in ad-dense areas.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Retraced Path was our first legendary Trace Rifle, and has some very useful combinations. Use the barrel and battery to improve range, stability, reload speed or battery capacity. Shoot to Loot is really useful in raids and end-game content, particularly if you're a Warlock running Cenotaph Mask to mark targets. You have a range of second-column trait perk options - One For All is an easily triggered 35% damage boost, or Golden Tricorn provides a useful 15% with one stack or 50% with two (easily achieved with the solar toolkit!). The Hot Swap origin trait is always useful for a snappier gunfeel when you swap weapons.

Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. While Eager Edge was the unique Dares perk back in the day, it's appeared elsewhere since so Relentless Strikes is probably the more sensible first column trait perk to combine with Surrounded in the second for 35% (41.8% when enhanced) bonus damage when in a crowd.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Hitting 3 targets in PvE is certainly easier than hitting multiple targets in PvP. If you can make Stats for All work in PvP I will be impressed. A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column. Wellspring could pair well with Demolitionist for even more ability energy, or Desperate Measures for a damage bonus without needing a weapon kill to start."

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills.

If you want more of a long ranged tube shotgun roll, Impulse Amplifier will make the grenade shot near instant. With the way special ammo is shaking up in the crucible through the meter or boxes, I think some of the best perks for Mountaintop are the swap perks, Harmony and Recombination.

Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots.

// Edge Transit
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction."

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse’s defining trait, Master of Arms, being brought down to a 15% damage buff makes it more manageable as a weapon and less dominant in PvE and PvP. Instead you could opt for consistency perks like Dynamic Sway Reduction, or Tap the Trigger. Threat Detector and Hip-Fire Grip are both excellent but have more limiting use cases; distance and non-ADS respectively. Desperate Measures is a better lethality perk as it can activate while stowed, so once you get a grenade or melee kill it lets you relive the 20% damage bonus of pre-nerf Master of Arms."

// Falling Guillotine
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well. Desperate Measures is the best of both worlds combining Adrenaline Junkie / Swashbuckler and Golden Tricorn." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

Arrowhead Brake is the best in slot for making the recoil direction vertical, but if you don't need that, Corkscrew Rifling or Fluted Barrel for the added stats. Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched.

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If you were to take a roll into the Crucible, I would recommend Moving Target or Explosive Payload in the third column. Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

The alternative way is with Fitted Stock to bring you right up to 100 recoil direction meaning you can slot in Smallbore or even Hammer-Forged Rifling for more range. You drop some handling unless you make that up in your barrel."|tags:pvp,controller

// Forbearance (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss.

// Edge Transit (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction."

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities.

Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

// Elsie's Rifle (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Elsie's Rifle is a throwback to D1, and another good weapon Bungie could have brought back was Murmur, the element switching fusion *from the Moon.* Jokes aside, Elsie's Rifle is incredible. Rewind Rounds or Feeding Frenzy paired with Desperate Measures or Desperado, any combination of the above will be more than lethal. Arrowhead Brake is a must have regardless of what activity you bring this rifle into, I don't know if there's a small bug within the timelines of this rifle but having Arrowhead Brake fixes a large majority of issues."

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If you were to take a roll into the Crucible, I would recommend Moving Target or Explosive Payload in the third column. Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Darkest Before is now changed up and swapped to solar. With this change it synergizes better with solar subclass verbs. Heal Clip and Incandescent are fantastic together and allow you to push out your engagement ranges a bit further because it’s a pulse rifle.

// Wild Style
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am glad to see more obtainable double-fire grenade launchers. Wilderflight is great, but being locked behind a dungeon means most players won’t even see it drop. Being a Vanguard reward allows more players to obtain it, and I love that as the double-fire is a very fun and interesting option within our ever-expanding arsenal. For PvE you’re looking for the tried and true Envious Assassin, this paired with Incandescent will clear rooms and deal some great damage against bosses. Unrelenting is a great option if you’re committing to using Wild Style as your main weapon, the extra healing plus synergy with Solar verbs will make you unkillable."

// Wild Style
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Wild Style and by extension all double-fire grenade launchers have one limiting factor, and that is that it fires two shots at once. If your one grenade bounces away you lose half your damage. With Bungie’s architecture it happens more often than not. Disorienting Grenades will allow you to still blind even if one goes away, and High-Velocity Rounds will keep your arc tighter to make bounces less punishing (if you’re not purposefully bouncing shots)."

A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload, for you to keep uptime for Onslaught, in the second trait column, to boost RPM for additional damage to mow down adds. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction.

If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You can find the Heal Clip/ Incandescent trait perk combination on other pulse rifles but it is very nice to help keep your fireteam's health topped up, while you're incinerating crowds of minor spec adds while synergising with your solar subcalss fragments. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

A Sudden Death returns as void, rather than arc shotgun with the rather poor stats you'd expect from a Year 1 gun.

If you are making do, then Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling pad out the Handling stats a little as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag speeds up shots, or Tactical Mag adds one to the mag as the magazine perk. You could take your choice of either Threat Detector's Handling and Reload buffs or Envious Assassin for an overflowed magazine to start an engagement with.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "We [probably] have a scout in our vault we use for PvE. Do we need another? Well technically no. Taraxippos doesn’t do anything another scout couldn’t do equally or better. If you somehow don’t have one, then yeah. Grind yourself one out this Guardian Games. It’s easy to get and you’ll probably have more than you know what to do with." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "With the update to scout rifle damage, I think there’s a good case for this scout being a low-key meta choice. It won’t have as good of a feeling as the rapid-fire frames, nor the oomph of the high-impacts. But the extra movement speed and the extra flexibility could aid certain builds and loadouts. I love kill clip for really deleting guardians in 6s, but it falls off hard in 3s." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Scouts are weird. Lets just start there. I like the idea of scouts, but in practice.. Theyre just strange. BUT, they do one thing quite well.. Precision kills. So, between Enlightened Action keeping your reload up and making the gun feel snappy, and then Hatchling helping you dispatch groups of enemies at the same time, I think this roll has a lot of low end potential for fun. Which lets be honest.. Isn't that what we all want?" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Next thing you know, you're making Shaxx proud and it's all because you've become a dueling monster and all the bonus Stability makes you unflinchable. That's the theory anyway, but in my hands?

//notes:SirStallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Cards on the table, I picked rangefinder because it was the best "neutral" perk in that 4th column, but it can absolutely be any other perk there you want. The rest of the roll is all about making your weapon a stat monster for 1v1s. I like 720s for 3v3 gamemodes, I think they're fun as heck. So giving my weapon a stat package that would make Banshee blush is always my goal. With 85 base Recoil Direction, the bonus handling and stability felt like a no brainer for me, Perp Motion is gonna bump that stab even further and anything else is just icing on the cake."

Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. Gyrfalcon void Hunters can already apply volatile rounds at will so kills to proc Repulsor Brace in the first trait column will be easy - but be aware this overrides the Void reserve Shield so you don't get the boost to class ability regeneration - but you do get the origin trait boost instead. In CQC you'll probably find the Overshield damage reduction really useful anyway, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence. With the second column, as you don't need Destabilizing Rounds, Surrounded is a great passive boost to damage - up to 47% when you're able to enhance the perk. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful in the play loop to get your dodge back faster - Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for velocity, handling and reload speed. Field Prep in the first trait column makes up somewhat for the inventory stat, and when it's enhanced it's only one shot away from max ammo, without the need for any reserve mods (one would get you to the max). Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns in end-game activities. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy?

There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. Parabellum has decent stats and a nice clean sight picture. Round out the range, stability and recoil direction stats to your preference with the barrel perk. You're looking for a snappy reload, so Alloy Mag is the best mag perk choice, but the stability from Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell make Parabellum easier to control. Heal Clip in the first trait column and Frenzy in the second work well - Frenzy boosts reload speed (and handling) to 100 anyway as well as adding a +15% damage boost. The fast reload, means it's easier to proc Cure from Heal Clip, which you can use with Ember of Benevolence on a solar subclass. The Field-Tested origin trait is a slow burn but, if you can stay alive, the stacks do build up to have a pretty significant impact on the gunfeel stats.

You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

For this roll, you'll be looking to block damage, so a Guard perk like Burst Guard or Balanced Guard works best. This is the only sword dropping in S23 with the combination of Flash Counter and Counterattack - get in close to a tanky enemy to bait them into a melee/slam attack, and then the combination of weaken and bonus damage provides +80% damage for 2s, and +20% for the next two, which should be enough time to put a serious dent in their health bar.

For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun.

@title:Season 23 Seasonal weapons
@description:Season of the Wish seasonal weapons, with the Dragon's Vengeance origin trait

// Appetence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), Ionized Battery, Overflow, Killing Tally
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three, and with it topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Headstone generates Stasis crystals on crit kills, so lets you build into Stasis verbs and fragments. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a void subclass. The reprised Vouchsafe has returned with a plethora of PvE possibilities. You get the +20 Mobility from the Lightweight Frame, which is always great but on the downside you also have low Stability and Handling (not such a problem with the origin trait) and abysmal Recoil Direction. You can handle the wonky recoil with a combination of recoil and/or stability perks in the barrel and mag slots. You don't need a void subclass to make use of the trait combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds - they'll work perfectly well without - but you can improve the effect with void fragments. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. Retold Tale has okay stats compared to other precision frame shotguns and the trait pool is weighted towards PvP, but there's still some nice combinations here. First, for the barrel perk, Barrel Shroud, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful stats and for the mag slot while Assault Mag or Tactical Mag are the top two choices, Light Mag or Appended Mag aren't bad alternatives. For your trait combination, this is the first pellet shotgun that offers the the trait combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for aggressive CQC add clearing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

And while Night Watch has still kept some of its relevance over the years, Doom of Chelchis has overtaken Vouchsafe for the best in slot weapon. Vouchsafe does retain some great perks in Rapid Hit and Explosive Payload, while also adding in great perks like Repulsor Brace and Golden Tricorn. It might not be the ultimate best weapon, but it also doesn’t require any raiding." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Vouchsafe
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Lightweight frames in PvP are in an interesting spot. They don’t kill fast enough to be competitive, and any boosts don’t really elevate the weapon further. Golden Tricorn 2x does allow you to 3 shot any guardian at any resilience at a 0.60 TtK, but it requires two whole kills to get rolling and without additional ability kills you’ll be back at square one before you know it. Taraxippos and Eternal Blazon with Kill Clip or even Tarnished Mettle with Swashbuckler allow you to 3 crit after just one kill." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Waking Vigil
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Let’s talk about power creep. When Waking Vigil released it was a phenomenal arc hand cannon. Outclassed by Nation of Beasts for the best arc hand cannon. With its midlife refresh Waking Vigil was blessed with a reload perk and an AoE perk through Dragonfly. However it was still overshadowed by Nation of Beasts and by then Ancient Gospel. When the hand cannon merger happened, Waking Vigil lost its only claim to fame being a Lightweight hand cannon versus the aforementioned adaptives. While we still have some great perks going on currently, Waking Vigil is just a relic from the past." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Appentence
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Being a stasis trace rifle already gives Appetence viability in a lot of loadouts. No longer are you tied to Ager’s Scepter for a “kinetic” trace rifle. Appetence is also legendary so you open up a plethora of loadout possibilities. In PvE you can make the most of this trace rifle with Overflow and Killing Tally for a 21% Delirium-lite. Being able to walk over bricks of special to double the magazine capacity keeps Killing Tally primed and ready to rip into any wave of enemy you might have in front of you. If you prefer a more calculated approach or don’t want to use just one weapon, Headstone is extremely strong with the buffed Stasis subclasses." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Imperative
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Most of us already have. Workhorse PvE scout. If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively. I’d still recommend Rapid Hit over both as missing a shot is extremely unforgiving with the slower rate of fire.

As with most PvE bows you’re looking for a good combination of draw time and accuracy. Successful Warm-Up gives you a better draw time post-defeat, but has a bit less utility against higher health enemies. Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame hand cannons have not had their time in the spotlight for a while. Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer’s Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon. If you run void subclasses a lot you can take advantage of Golden Tricorn to maximize damage, making these fast firing hand cannons feel way more chunky than they normally are. Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range."

When Rampage and Outlaw were all we cared about. Things have shifted and more weapons are certainly popular. The only true competition Subjunctive needs to worry about is the Ikelos SMG. Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It’s not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec’ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets. With Golden Tricorn 2x you’ll have enough damage to look at enemies and they’ll become unalive from sheer admiration, and you’ll be able to chunk down majors with ease, Subsistence just keeps the chains rolling."

// Belisarius-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Belisarius-D comes from the crucible, and it belongs in the crucible. Rapid Hit and Headseeker are fantastic neutral perks that no one would argue belong together. Keep Away and Moving Target can substitute as well for a very strong neutral weapon. Eye of the Storm is conditional in that you will have to take damage, but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In the crucible you will be taking damage, so getting some extra benefits alongside that is all upsides. Kill Clip doesn’t change the time to kill enough to be noticeable unless you hit nothing but headshots. In which case you’ll drop down to a 0.60 TtK with 6 crits on Tier 8 Resilience or below. Without Kill Clip on those higher tiered resilience levels you’ll need 1 extra bullet, either way it still remains a two-burst as you won’t stop the burst mid-burst."

// Chivalric Fire
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller / M+KB): "Our full ritual playlist weapon is an interesting one. Caster frame swords have not been strong since their introduction. So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you’ll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we’re back to square one. Chivalric Fire is a great neutral sword that works best on Void subclasses, but you can utilize either orb generation or volatility to great success without committing to Void."

// Eye of Sol (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Here is a weapon that should not see much use in PvE. Unsurprisingly a PvP weapon is good in PvP, Eye of Sol returns but without Outlaw, Field Prep, or any real good reload perk. Nothing exists on Eye of Sol that will propel it to see any use in general PvE other than to practice for PvP. The best damage perk is either Firing Line or Vorpal Weapon. Precision Instrument is great but you’ll almost ever see the full benefits of it." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Naren’s Lance is an interesting weapon. It’s not quite dead on arrival, but it doesn’t do any one thing particularly well. Reconstruction and Precision Instrument are great paired with the rapid fire frame, allowing a ton of shots fired with increased damage. But then it falls in that it’s a rapid fire frame and firing at 140 RPM while maintaining full crits is extremely difficult." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Over in the crucible it also lags behind without two of the most important perks. Opening Shot or Snapshot Sights, and while you can get away without either of those perks and still see success, you’ll have to find handling and accuracy perks elsewhere. Keep Away is fantastic for reducing your accuracy cone, and Elemental Capacitor could bump you up to 100 handling with an arc subclass.

// Vengeful Whisper
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I’m happy for more variants of weapons. Vengeful Whisper being a strand bow opens up some loadout flexibility and covers your strand subclass verbs. It’s less useful without Match Game but it can still be useful for taking out shields faster. Archer’s Tempo is fantastic on bows for lowering successive draw times, and Precision Instrument fits nicely as you’ll want to hit those crits, the draw time allowing you a bit of forgiveness lining up those crit shots. You could even switch it up and go with Explosive Payload and Successful Warm-Up if you’re using this in lower and PvE where you can one shot everything to keep Successful Warm-Up going."

// Indebted Kindness
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Indebted Kindness is extremely interesting in the crucible. Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn’t incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn’t rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Being able to spread Sever through Slice and Chain Reaction or spawn Threadlings from a distance makes this weapon an incredibly strong addition to an all Strand loadout. It might not be the best for boss damage or the best for add clear, but I think it will find a nice home in some Strand loadouts." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this and then the SOFA (Stats/ One For All) combination of trait perks to round out the stats further and add a chunky 35% bonus damage. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10sand grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s (although you can interact with any elemental drop).

// Stay Frosty (PvE backup roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Appended Mag), Enlightened Action, Desperado
//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. Backup PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you've not already got a Stasis pulse rifle with Desperado, this can provide you with an option - if you have, then you can pass.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of bulkier Minor, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can bypass that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one. In the first trait column, Grave Robber procs on glaive melees, or Field prep boosts reserves, and reload speed when crouched, and Close to Melee in the second boosts melee damage by 30% for a projectile hit.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and Champions in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. But it has a trick that now other sword can do - the Cold Steel trait perk. For single target damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. As your trait perk combination, both Relentless Strikes and Cold Steel proc off three hits, with the first two Cold Steel hits Stasis slowing and the third hit freezing enemies. That covers Overload and Unstoppable Champions. Throw on Radiant from a solar subclass to cover Barriers too, and you have the sword equivalent of Riptide which will freeze lock Majors with every third hit, and which you can apply Stasis subclass fragments too as well.

First-choice PvE pick for support against Major and Boss spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Precision Instrument in the second could make for an interesting combination to apply Sever to majors and bosses from range - even when they're immune to damage - to reduce their damage output by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity (effectively a 40% DR for the whole fireteam) as well as doing decent, for a primary weapon, damage with the boost from Precision Instrument. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Collective Action in the second makes this a bit of a Swiss-army knife of weapons. Slice, with Strand of Continuity, Severs an enemy to reduce their damage output by 40% for 15s - you can use this effect on Majors and Bosses, even during an immunity phase to grant an effective 40% damage reduction for your whole fireteam. Or, apply Sever to a minor and kill it to spawn a Tangle that you can use with Collective Action for a 20% damage boost for 7s, then rinse and repeat.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy Minor Spec add-clearing in general content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. With Explosive Head appearing in the first trait column as the support perk for a change, you have the option to go double-damage with Hatchling (unfortunately Precision Instrument only boosts precision damage so is a bit of a trap perk with Explosive Head), particularly when paired with Thread of Evolution. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for against Major or Boss Spec enemies, particularly with Strand subcalsses, in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception, having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice, taking the stat to a manageable 84. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag (seven) as Appended and Extended Mag, but either of those work too. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively, while Slice in the second trait makes this possibly the best special weapon to pair with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon - reducing the Severed target's damage output by 40% for 10s (15s with Thread of Continuity if you're using a Strand subclass) - an effective additional 40% DR for your whole fireteam.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't.

Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Stay Frosty is a bit of an odd weapon. It lost a bit of utility from last years model, but gained a quality of life perk in Enlightened Action. Desperado is a fun perk but nothing about this weapon will break the meta or shake up the game." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Panda (PvP / Controller): "There are two versions of this weapon you can get. Don't take into MnK or controller as seriously. The MnK roll is better for 6v6 or slaying play styles. The controller roll is better for 3v3 or more neutral play styles. Both will feel great but have different utilities." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This weapon was better last year, imo. Enlightened Action and Headstone may very well work excellently together, but I'm sad we lost Thresh, which is a sentiment I'm sure not many people share. BUT.. I still think it's worth going for. Enlightened is a chonky buff and if Headstone can help trigger it, it's gonna be a fun combo." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Stallion (PvP / Controller): "I never got this roll last year, so I will be going for it again. I do not think this roll needs explaining, you kill 1 person (pretty easily because 450s feel great imo) then use that momentum to carry you through the rest of the match with a nice range and handling bump from Killing Wind and a nice damage bump from Kill Clip. This is my favourite combo in PvP. I needs it." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cold Steel is Zephyr's claim to fame. Zephyr is the only sword with Cold Steel and you'll want to stack as many charge time benefits as possible. Duelist's Trance grants +60 to charge rate and both Guard Resistance and Endurance. This all allows you to heavy swing more frequently. Stacking the extra slow debuff faster. Tempered Edge also gives you more ammo while adding more impact as well. Dealing better damage is always good." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Panda (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Zephyr was one of my favorite swords when it was introduced in season 2. I still think it looks incredible. In PvP you'll want some good guard resistance so you can get close and if you happen to have multiple enemies stacked up you can get Chain Reaction kills. More booms equals better, no?" Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I won't lie, I straight lifted this roll from last years post because I never got it and I still think it could be interesting for a stasis build. Wellspring to keep your abilities up, which will in turn provide slow/freeze in combination with Cold Steel to leave targets more vulnerable to more attacks. There is potential for a fun cycle there, and it utilises Cold Steel which is what makes this sword particularly unique." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1911078836&perks=3592538738,3650930298

// Zephyr
//notes:Stallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Unfortunately, Zephyr would not be my first pick for PvP swords. Its not craftable, Cold Steel is pointless and its not an interesting frame. BUT. This would be what I'd take into PvP if I had to. Duelist benefits the player after a kill until you put the sword away, but since heavy is not very frequent in PvP, you're likely gonna commit to using all your ammo up. So Duelist gives the best benefit in slot imo. Vorpal is a nice safety net incase your heavy spawn gets assaulted by a super (I've seen it happen, it's terrifying), you might be able to fight back a little easier."

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don't know how often this glaive will be used over the crafted gloves but there's a nice niche between Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee. If you get any glaive kill you'll activate Beacon Rounds, with the added tracking you can shoot off in the general direction of a thrall and with that kill you'll activate Close to Melee to deal an extra 30% more melee damage. Any additional damage with your melee or projectile you'll keep up Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee to continue the chaining of better tracking and better damage."

//notes:Panda (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "With Auxiliary Reserves you get some great shield duration. With Light Mag and Keep Away you negate the reload speed loss from Auxiliary Reserves. All the range gives you a velocity of 130 m/s which is 1.11x times faster than the base 117 m/s. This extra speed will make the hit registration feel better. If you can manage to get Golden Tricorn 2x with one surge mod you can one hit kill any guardian 6 resilience or below. As you add one surge mod you can down an additional resilience tier. It scales 1:1." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Okay here's my thought process.. This weapon needs to be really unique to justify using over a crafted Glaive. What makes it unique is Beacon Rounds. Beacon Rounds are an ease of use perk, they're built to make you miss less shots without slowing down combat by aiming (gross, all my homies hate aiming). So my plan is to make myself a one man phalanx, storming forward with homing shots that aim themselves. Demolitionist to help me panic reload, plus just keeping my grenade energy up, and more shield duration to aid in the goal of becoming phalanx. Also, Honourable mention to Golden Tricorn potentially being very fun to mess around with." Recommended MW: Shield Duration.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Stallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Okay so.. Glaives in PvP. Not my favourite thing. But here's what I'm thinking: Max Range for max projectile speed, bonus handling to make it less hefty to switch to, Beacon Rounds because auto-aim potentially gooder, demo simply because there's nothing else I feel is worth using in that slot. High Impact Reserves is only a 6% damage boost, Golden Tricorn might be tricky to keep active in PvP, Lead From Gold serves no purpose in PvP.. It's just tricky. I'm sorry I can't provide more, I'm really not a glaive in PvP kinda fella." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

With Slideshot you can invest the rest of your stats into a mix of range and stability to still hit 100 range and have a whopping 76 stability.

Subsistence, which will keep your mag topped up after a kill so you can keep chaining. But the most interesting to me is Overflow. The combination of Overflow and Res Burst is the ultimate combo workhorse for me, you will have multiple back to back Res Burst shots to unload into a boss or to clear a group of mobs. It's the best of both worlds, baked into 1 gun." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

This roll should help all of those problems at least a little bit. Slideshot, so reloading is as easy as scraping your knees. Eye of the Storm to help you combat missing bolts due to being shot while charging. Charge Time reductions.. because charge time reductions.

As for the main traits, Unrelenting has been tried and true for me, I love this perk. I don't always need it, but it's there for me when I do. Frenzy is a classic perk, everybody knows how good it is, we love it for it's constant damage buff, but more importantly it boosts handling and reload.

The difference between minimum range and maximum range is like 3.5m, and while that might be significant if this weapon is your primary, it is not significant in my use case. A secondary. A sidearm, with a substantial heft boost. As much handling as I can squeeze out without losing a usable amount of stability, then Perpetual Motion to help those stats even further.

If you want bossing, you can very easily switch from Incan to Target Lock or Vorpal, but for me I like to rip through groups with an LMG. It makes me happy.

Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist. Both origin traits are more PvP-orientated, but Nadir Focus's extra range and accuracy for free is a nice little bonus.

(Backup PvE pick for solar synergy and Minor Spec add-clearing in general content, if you don't already have a decent Incandescent pulse rifle, and haven't got around to shaping a BXR-55 Battler yet. Jurassic Green is a solar rapid-fire pulse, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty. It's got a similar stat range to its other world-drop peers, but comes a poor second to end-game drops in the energy slot. The recoil direction is a frankly awful 50 at base. The best even Arrowhead Brake can do is bring it up to a not entirely awful 80, and you can choose a little extra range, stability or reload speed with your mag slot perk. Then, in the first trait column as the support perk there are a few decent options to help with reload and gunfeel - Keep Away, Loose Change, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence. Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk is great for add clear, as you spread solar scorch and ignite around. The Field Tested origin trait is probably the better PvE trait of the two - it'll just work steadily in the background to gradually improve your gunfeel, as long as you don't die!

(First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Mechabre (it's so obviously a pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. One thing you could do is use it to apply jolt to beefier targets at a distance. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk. Building towards the end, Flared Magwell gives the biggest boost to reload speed out of the magazine perks, with Tactical Mag a decent alternative. Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85. Get one kill against an add, reload and then Voltshot in the second column as the signature perk can apply jolt to your next target from a safe distance for burst and AoE damage. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

Use the barrel perk to get shots to the target as fast as possible, and Spike Grenades adds 13.3% to total damage for a direct hit in the magazine slot. In the first column, for the support trait perk, saves a reserves perk on your chest and significantly boosts reload when you crouch. Explosive Light is the second column as the signature perk adds +52.5% to total damage for up to six shots for great burst damage, as well as boosting the blast radius to 100 - great against Majors surrounded by minor adds. The Nadir Focus origin trait boosts your shot velocity further, which is a nice little bonus.

// Horror Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "So Horror Story is stasis now. Kinda cool, but not the biggest draw. The combo I'm looking for is Enlightened Action and Target Lock. The two of them together give you bonus handling, reload, and damage. As long as you're connecting shots you'll get the benefits of both!" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=365154968,3828510309

// Horror Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP you could swap out Enlightened Action for Dynamic Sway Reduction or maybe even Demolitionist. But I'd say that the handling bonus will feel really nice. A base of 37 handling isn't ideal, so the slight bonus from Arrowhead Brake coupled with Enlightened Action will make this auto rifle feel more like an SMG." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=365154968,3828510309

// Horror Story
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This gun will be special. Not meta shifting or game breaking, but special. For me, there's an undeniable good feel when it comes to 450s, I love using them but finding a way to best make use of them typically comes down to how I can nuke the most trash mobs in the fastest time. In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass. Other weapons with this combo have existed, and they're multiclass. A self contained stasis machine. I will be hunting for this, for sure." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=124408337,3523296417

// Horror Story
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "As a primarily controller player, I believe 450s are some of the easiest guns to control. Stability is not as necessary, but preference is a thing and you should absolutely commit to whichever stat you feel is best. But the trait combo remains the same for my ideal. I will never just be using one gun, chances are if I get special ammo I'm going to be trying to use that special ammo and discord benefits me when I inevitably succeed. OR.. more likely.. When I use my 450/450 combo and bust out a Harmony suros sidearm, this gun will support a flip flop swip swap playstyle that I enjoy very very much." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=365154968,3978468247

// Horror Story
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "As a precision frame AR, you have a built-in horizontal recoil reduction so you are given the freedom to lean more into other attributes with your barrel and mod. For PvE, this is one of the few guns that can get both Demolitionist and Headstone to quickly regenerate grenade energy (the others being Unending Tempest from the Crucible, and Fire and Forget from Season of the Seraph)."

// Horror Story
//notes:Clegmir (PvP / Controller): "For PvP, adding just a bit more range to make sure you get the most out of your aim assist is where it’s at. Having a third column option for Elemental Capacitor is handy as that perk can have a substantial impact on the feel of the gun, especially if you don’t get something like Frenzy to max your Handling and Reload. Though there are a lot of damage perks in the fourth column, Stasis has an easy time creating shards so leaning into Collective Action is the play, I think."

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Both rolls for PvP are very similar except for two differences in stat investments.

It may not be as consistent as Vorpal, and it probably won't be the ideal for long boss phases, but for eliminating minibosses and champions, this will be my go to. Throwing an arcbolt to jolt the big guy and kill some trash mobs, giving me a damage boost and a pulse AOE around the target.. nice. Throwing a void grenade to debuff the target, killing some trash mobs, giving me the damage boost.. nice.

The recoil direction is a bit shonky, so Arrowhead Brake cleans that up a bit, but if you feel able to control it, Fluted Barrel adds to handling for general snappiness. You can choose from any of the combat effect rounds as the mag perk, depending on your preference. Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk works well with new-to-season-22 Precision Instrument in the second as the signature perk to keep the higher damage stacks going for longer, before you reload. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell rounds out a few more gunfeel stats, or take the combat effect mag perk of your choice. For end-game activities, Enlightened Action in the first trait slot as the support perk provides passive boosts to reload and handling, which you should hit max stacks of quickly, and Collective Action in the second column as the signature perk is a reliable 20% damage boost for collecting an elemental pickup. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. If you're looking for an arc shotgun, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts.

Heliocentric (translation "sun-centred") has great base stats, so you can go for a little extra range, stability or handling with your barrel park - that's pretty much down to your preference. Reload will be the most important magazine perk stat boosts, so Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Alloy May are good picks. The unique trait combination that the chase is on for is Heal Clip as the first column support perk, and Kill Clip as the second column signature perk. Proccing both with a reload after a kill gives you and anyone near a burst of Cure, while adding 25% damage for 5s. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. We'll be using traits to boost handling and reload speed, so you can use the barrel and mag options to push up stability as much as you can to improve control. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game (as at v7.2.0.3), and a new and very chasable trait pairing. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost in the barrel, followed by Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can choose any of the combat effect rounds as your mag perk. In the first trait column as the support perk, the new combination worth chasing is Heal Clip, for the Cure for yourself and nearby fireteam on reloads after a kill, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk to maximise handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

Whether that's Retrofit Escapade, Planck's Stride, Recurrent Impact, Shattered Cipher, or reaching all the way back even a Thermal Erosion. That being said, the only direct competition Eleatic Principle has is with Planck's Stride, which I think Eleatic Principle blows Planck's out of the water. Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit. You won't have access to a reload or mag extending perk but you can make the shots easier to land with Zen Moment, Well Rounded, or after some kills even Heating Up."

Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with.

// Deadpan Delivery - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "I'm not going to lie. I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range.

If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do.

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

// Nightshade - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Nightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on. With my roll choices you can have 100 recoil direction with a counterbalance mod and 32m of in game range. Plenty to take advantage of the bonuses of Keep Away."

// The Showrunner - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

// The Showrunner - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "In PvP The Showrunner is going to be the least used SMG this season right behind Unending Tempest. Go see why I think that SMG is better in the Vendor breakdown. The Showrunner has some great perks in Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction, Rangefinder if you're really looking for consistency at range, or more neutral perks like Well Rounded or Heating Up. However, the issue is really the frame we were given. Lightweight SMGs are not "in the spotlight." While I think this SMG can serve you well as a kinetic Funnelweb the perks to note aren't as strong. You can almost hit 100 range with Full Bore, Ricochet, Well Rounded 2x, and Fragile Focus, but that sacrifices Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction for only 23m of range."

// Swordbreaker - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Swordbreaker is the returning shotgun from Crota’s End. Here we have a case of “interesting but not incredible.” Being able to get both Pugilist and One-Two Punch is a fantastic combo, but I feel that most people will opt for Subsistence to forget what reloading is like. Demolitionist is good for grenade heavy builds and also for forgetting the reload animation. In the final column, One-Two Punch is the best in slot, but on a Strand ability focused build you can get away with Golden Tricorn for even more damage. Sword Logic is also here if you want to run through enemies like Doom Guy and shotgun everything." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Swordbreaker - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Swordbreaker is interesting. It might take the place of the best lightweight frame shotgun. Being craftable, tying with the highest handling within its archetype, and being able to hit 100 range are just a few things that makes Swordbreaker interesting. You can choose a variety of different perks, you only need one handling perk and Threat Detector to hit 100 handling with an animation scalar, meaning you can invest the rest of your perks into range. Going with Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, and Opening Shot puts you at 91 range and 100 handling. Or you can opt for 100 range and 91 handling by swapping a few things around. The best part of this shotgun is its versatility." Recommended MW: Handling or Range.|tags:controller,pvp

Subsistence as we know allows us to bypass the reload stat and your choice of damage perks will slot in perfectly. One combo to keep an eye on is the Repulsor Brace / Destabilizing Rounds combo.

// Kept Confidence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Tactical Mag, Loose Change, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus (Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking") has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots.

Backup PvE pick for Minor Spec add-clear in general content. Shapeable. The Eleatic Principle, is a philosophical argument that only items which have the capacity to affect or be affected are. Make of that what you will... Unfortunately, this is not the arc rapid-fire LMG you are looking for. If you really don't have a better arc option, then tidy up the recoil direction - you're putting out a lot of bullets - with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel, and High-Caliber, Ricochet or Armor-Piercing Rounds as the magazine perk.

// The Eremite - The Eremite PvP God Roll (god-pvp,pvp,controller)
//notes: Range Masterwork. Taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csuxec3lFcs "Slickdraw gives you 100 handling no matter what else you run on your weapon, plus a .95x animation  duration multiplier, which is a scalar that takes you past what 100 handling can even do. The automatic 100 handling allows me to do WHATEVER I want to the detriment of handling, because it will ALWAYS be 100. So I can run Extended Barrel to bump my Recoil Direction to 85 and my range up 10, without any drawbacks of handling like I normally would... I suggest running this one of two different ways. Elemental Capacitor if you're on either void or stasis, and then Golden Tricorn if you run any other subclass."  tags:god-pvp,pvp,controller,mnk

// The Wizened Rebuke - PvP (god-pvp,pvp,controller)
//notes: Recommended MW: Charge Time Recommended Mod: Targeting. Use with a Cascade Point or Harmony weapon. The idea here is to quickly swap to this and secure a Backup Plan kill, then you'll have 100 handling to swap back to your primary and have 100 handling there as well. Should fire extremely fast with all the charge time perks, and you'll still 4 bolt any resil. tags:god-pvp,pvp,controller

// A Distant Pull
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don’t think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Age-Old Bond
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed. High-Impact Frame(360) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "I am excited for this auto to pair with a void build using both Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for a self buff and add clear. Golden Tricorn pairs well if you get Volatile from your subclass or just want a stronger weapon. Dragonfly in the third column will get beefed up with Golden Tricorn so I can see some utility outside of direct void explosions that could be usable all the way up to GM levels." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Apex Predator
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Adaptive Frame(20) Solar Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Apex Predator is the best rocket launcher in the game. With enhanced Reconstruction you can almost always have a rocket ready to fire at any given time. With Explosive Light you get incredible amounts of damage and orbs are easy to make now. Bait and Switch is another great damage perk and does more damage, but I find Explosive Light easier to work with, especially with the new mod system revolving around orbs of power. Simple answer is, use Explosive Light if you’re lazy, if you’re trying to min-max use Bait and Switch." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"There is nothing more I want this season than BrayTech Osprey with Cluster Bomb and Chain Reaction. Seeing all those explosions, especially at once, will bring a smile across my face. I’d also like to see how it interacts with Lasting Impression. Do the clusters drop on the initial hit or, more likely, once the explosion goes off? There will be some obvious testing to do this season, but I want this rocket launcher for the sheer fun of it. Cluster Bomb might be useful again when coupled with Frenzy or Golden Tricorn’s damage increase." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bug-Out Bag
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(900) Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Chattering Bone
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Lightweight Frame(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Chattering Bone is showing its best footing yet. From a niche but underwhelming raid weapon to arguably the best in its archetype. Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone’s utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don’t know if the two of those perks would work together. It might be a case of the curated where you have damage that starts at the top half and once that goes away you have damage by the bottom half." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Comfort
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Aggressive Frame(25) Stasis Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Cold Comfort has some interesting perks but nothing stands out for me. It has a low blast radius with good velocity. If you crafted a Bump in the Night you already have a good Chill Clip rocket launcher at your disposal. I like that Bait and Switch is on more weapons now and Explosive Light has taken over my heavy slot, so while there’s an argument to upgrade past Bump in the Night, unless you get either of the other perks I would not worry about keeping a Chill Clip Cold Comfort." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Combined Action
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive Frame(120) Arc Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Combined Action is an interesting 120 for PvE. Hand cannons are not the most meta weapon to use in higher level PvE, but Voltshot combined with a low magazine can make it reliable and give you a reason to reload this hand cannon.

// Different Times
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Strand Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability. Which puts Multikill Clip as the best damage perk." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Handling. Adaptive Frame(140) Solar Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "I don’t think Epochal Integration is a great example of a World Drop, but it is from Neumona. I guess that counts, right? Epochal Integration is a set roll, so it makes my life a lot easier. Incandescent and Stats for All are your choices for PvE, you can proc Stats for All after one explosion kill, if that explosion tags two more enemies. In regular activities this is often and makes Epochal Integration feel amazing, the issue is you cannot refresh Stats for all, and when it does go away it makes the gun feel 1/4 as good." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

It exists as both legendary shards and has some incredibly niche use cases. The first of which is a rapid-fire sniper with the damage of an aggressive with Cascade Point. You will certainly want to bump up the mag to at least 5 in order to take some advantage of it. Envious Assassin can also help you out here as both perks require other weapon kills to activate. The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot.

"Last Rite is very much a solid Ritual Weapon. It doesn’t exist as an incredibly strong scout, but it does come with a solid set of perks. Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man’s Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that’s necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It’s certainly one of the scouts of all time." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

My favorite little scout-auto love child. This time with random rolls!!! I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don’t even really care about viability, it will just be fun." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You’re going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec.

@title:Season 21 Ghost of the Deep Dungeon weapons
@description:Ghost of the Deep Dungeon weapons with the Restoration Ritual origin trait

// New Pacific Epitaph (PvE first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, (Demolitionist, Lead From Gold, Unrelenting), Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist (which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw), or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. You'll need stability on a controller, so start with a stability barrel and a Stability masterwork. In the mag, the Combat Effect perks all provide utility. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk, and Frenzy in the second column as your signature perk. When everything's active, you'll be near 50 for stability, 100 Handling and Reload Speed, and have a 15% damage boost, which should make for a good kinetic slot SMG option if you need one.

Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. While the Recoil Direction is terrible, we'll control that with one of the traits. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore help fill in a combination of handling, stability or range. Flared Magwell further fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. To help control the recoil, Heating Up adds both stability and recoil direction after a kill to make this very easy to use, and pair will with Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk, for Strand subclass synergy.

Overflow is laughably good on a special weapon, as a first trait column support park, doubling the magazine size just for picking up an ammo brick, even when stowed.

@description:The Giggity episode, presenting reprised Last Wish raid weapons with the Explosive Pact origin trait

// Chattering Bone (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Kill Clip, Rampage
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag will speed up the reload with ideally a reload speed masterwork (fast reloads keep the two damage perks uptime maximised), as well as adding in some stability and, in the latter's case, an extra burst. The old spicy Kill Clip/Rampage roll is still available, and is unique on a pulse rifle to this weapon as at S21. Proccing both gives a whopping 66.2% damage bump to go on a roll with. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell in the magazine add reload speed, stability and, for the former, an extra burst. Pair that with Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk, to make successive bursts easier to land and boost reload speed further. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Transfiguration (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Rampage, Kill Clip

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. The range is pretty good - Fluted Barrel, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful bumps to stats, or if you want to push the range out by a few metres more, Hammer-Forged Rifling can also work in the barrel. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. This is the only scout rifle you can roll with Rampage and Kill Clip together which, when procced together, add 66.4% damage - possibly one that's more for memes, but it could still be fun. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// The Supremacy (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Fourth Times the Charm
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Age-Old Bond (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Repulsor Brace, Destabilising Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use). If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

The new Eddy Current sounds like it might do the job, but you'll have to sprinting for 3s after a kill to proc it, which gives you a tiny window to reload of 0.8s or less, so good old Perpetual Motion is probably the more reliable option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Techeun Force (however Saint Kabr pronounces it...) is reprised in a new, highly desirable perk set. I say set, it's really just one perk in particular. The stats to start are pretty good, although the recoil direction needs some attention, so Arrowhead Brake will take that to a controllable 90. For a damage roll, Liquid Coils is the obvious choice - don't worry, we'll get around the charge time penalty later. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Rewind Rounds means you should be able to keep shooting until the battery is empty - you need a minimum of two shots in the mag to proc it, but then it reloads 2 shots from reserves. Finally, as the signature perk in the second trait slot, the new-for-S21 Controlled Burst drops your charge time by 10% and increases damage by 20% just for hitting all your bolts, making this great for burst and sustained damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well). Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities. Aggressive hand cannons have two main weaknesses - handling and reload speed. Fortunately, there are season 21 perk combinations that can help with that! Start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk. You can go one of two ways with the magazine - either look for a perk that helps with reload or enjoy a combat effect perk and let the traits do the heavy lifting. While there are additional reload perks in the first trait column, you shouldn't really need them, so Wellspring offers useful ability energy on kills as your support trait. Then, in the second trait column as your signature perk, Frenzy maxes out handling and reload speed when procced, as well as providing a solid 15% weapon damage boost. The Dream Works origin trait is useful in a fireteam to get the occasional overflowed magazine in a firefight.

In the second trait column, as your signature perk, the second tier of Golden Tricorn can be difficult to proc with Stasis - shattering a target that's frozen with a Glacier Grenade will do it or, if you're a Hunter, your Shurikens will also work. To support that, you could go one of two ways with your first column trait - Rapid Hit, to speed up the reload speed and take full advantage of the 50% damage boost, or Pugilist to get melee energy back so you can proc it again sooner.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game activities. Loaded Question is back, and has some interesting new combinations. Being a high-impact fusion rifle, there are only five bolts, so stability is slightly less of an issue - Fluted Barrel adds useful handling, and Hammer-Forged Rifling or Smallbore add Range as the barrel perk. There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, can be used with Controlled Burst - hit all the bolts to get +20% to damage and 10% reduced charge time to burst down Majors and maybe for the occasional boss DPS phase.

// THE SWARM (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Anti-barrier Champion use in end-game activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For use against Barrier Champions, Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage to shields and barrier, which is boosted a further 10% with Under-Over in the first trait slot as the support perk. In the second slot, the new-for-Lightfall Kinetic Tremors as the signature perk adds bonus AoE damage for 12 hits (or four bursts), damaging the stunned Champion and any adds within 5m. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Recommended MW: any will work, depending on your preference, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

First-choice PvE pick for chunky add-clear use in endgame activities. The stats on Unexpected Resurgence make it the best adaptive glaive in the sandbox as at Season 21. Every Haft choice involves a trade-off but for most, the improved shield from Auxiliary Reserves, or maybe the range (which = projectile speed) from Supercooled Accelerator, are worth the penalty to reload speed, which we can get around. In the mag, Appended Mag for the extra shot (Extended doesn't do anything more for you), or Accurized Rounds for the range are options, and if reload speed is still a worry, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out. In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, and Unstoppable Force as the second column signature perk is a natural pairing, boosting damage by 20% for blocking the same damage with your shield. As an arc speacial weapon, you can also build into blinding and Jolting verbs with an arc subclass, and don't forget the Alacrity origin trait for solo content to pretty much max out range and reload speed, and add 10 Aim Assist too.

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Submachine guns are the perfect run and gun weapon. They have better range than a sidearm, and feel better for a more run-and-gun play style than an auto rifle. Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3559361670&perks=3708227201,4071163871

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "This is the best version of the title we have seen. This almost competes with the like of Shayura's Tarrabah, IKELOS and Immortal. No adept mods, not the best range, but having rangefinder is an incredible bonus. Dynamic Sway Reduction is icing on the Title's cake for allowing a smooth shooting experience." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// The Title
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For me personally, I like to full send into one particular element, Void Subclass with Void Weapons, making the most of the keywords from the subclass. As such, I don't value Pugilist for void. I just don't like the melee abilities for the most part and that's okay. [...] I do wish Repulsor was a column 3 perk, but I understand why it isn't. All that combined with Classy Contender will make this weapon a mainstay on my Gyrfalcon hunter or Devourlock once Volatile Flow is no longer on our artifact." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Title
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): "I don't like Rangefinder. [...] BUT there's no denying that people like it, and they should. So it's very easily swapped in, in place of Vorpal. Now then, why Vorpal? Well, it just feels like the best of the bunch for passive PvP usage. More damage on supers good. As for Flared Magwell over Ricochet or Hi-Cal, I like my stability bumped up when possible and there's nothing worse than being caught mid reload on something as heavy as a 750. Loader mods will help, but Flared is worth the investment for me." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// The Title
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This year my Titan is going to lean heavily into Repulsor Brace. I am one of the few that enjoys the shield throw in PVE, and this combo will ensure that I always have one ready. Endless shield throws and volatile enemies guarantee that my Titan can rest easy knowing he will always have an overshield to protect him." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Title
//notes:Sneecher (PvP / Controller): "For those hoping for/dreading an energy slot version of The Immortal, Target Lock is nowhere to be found. Despite that, the gun still has the same strong combo of Dynamic Sway and Rangefinder. Perpetual Motion is also a great choice for people who prefer that. I don’t love Threat Detector on aggressive frame SMGs, since the base ADS range is outside of Threat Detector’s activation range, but if you love it, go nuts."

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Speedy reloads and threadlings? Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1168162263,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Everybody is going to be looking for Hatchling on this thing, so I'm not unique in that respect. A strand scout is new and unique, so leaning into that newness and uniqueness is great, absolutely worth it. However.. I am not going to be looking for Outlaw, instead I'm looking for FTTC. Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw. Obligatory Arrowhead because even on a scout rifle, 54 RD is brutal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1354429876,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): "I just need to shoutout that Kill Clip is right there in slot 4 also, and that would be great too. However, my thought process with this roll is that I want to make any given engagement as easy for me as possible (High stab, Zen Moment) while also being as much of a nuisance for the enemy as I can (Low flinch intake, Explosive Payload) So while I do think the KC 3 taps will go hard, I'm here to be a menace, not a slayer." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A new Strand weapon enters the fray! I'm always excited to get a new weapon type to add to my toolbox, and this weapon immediately gives us the Outlaw/Hatchling combo I've been waiting for (I still love you Round Robin). I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon. If you are intent on using this for GMs, you'll want Explosive Payload or maybe even Focused Fury instead." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1168162263,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvP / Controller): "There are a lot of options for PVP on this weapon, which took me a bit by surprise. If you like scouts at all, I am sure there is a roll for you somewhere in here. As a console player myself, I thoroughly enjoy high stability rolls. Scouts have such good coverage that they can handle a slight hit to range in favor of landing more shots quickly. Encore is a perk I think a lot of people sleep on, but after the rework it can be very effective in 6v6 modes. Add No Distractions and the Omolon origin trait, and you’ve got a workhorse ready to excel in all stats." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

@title:Season 20 Guardian Games weapons

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities for melee builds. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. Then, the tried and true combination of Pugilist in the first trait column as the support perk and Swashbuckler in the second as the signature perk is great for melee builds. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(140) Void Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Basso Ostinato is an interesting shotgun. We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

You might almost want to run counterbalance mod on it at all times. Accelerated Coils bumps up your damage per second. Lead from Gold is a very fun build and this could be a great major / champ killer. Compulsive Reloader and Voltshot would make a great pairing and clear rooms quickly. Not quite as strong as Reservoir Burst but an interesting arc alternative." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Unlike the last few this is truly a reprised version. Jorum’s Claw is a fun pulse that needs Arrowhead Brake to even be considered useful. In PvE you really don’t have a lot of choice. Outlaw and Arrowhead Brake are required. A mag extending perk is useful but not required. Frenzy does limit the need for outlaw but there aren’t really a lot of perks in that column I would take. Golden Tricorn has become one of my favorite perks to recommend for the sheer damage coupled with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. High-Impact(15) Solar Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Rocket Launchers have been around for so long it’s hard for any of them to break out. Damage is best reserved for Adept weapons or specific perks. Roar of the Bear does not get either of those. Vorpal is low stakes decent damage. Lasting Impression is great for killing yourself (ask me how I know) and Chain Reaction is best used when trying to clear adds. None of these are uncommon on other rockets within the last few seasons." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don’t have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are “maining” this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don’t love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don’t use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. High-Impact(340) Arc Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "In PvP you can run a counterbalance mod or Arrowhead Brake if you prefer a different mod. Keep Away is the in slot and paired with Headseeker you will have a great neutral pulse rifle. If you get the jump on someone you’ll have the bonus range and a near perfect first burst. They turn on you, start flinching you, headseeker then comes into play to keep you on that two-burst. Kill Clip is another viable option for a more forgiving two-burst after your first kill, especially when paired with Tunnel Vision. Elemental Capacitor will only accentuate the neutral game of this pulse no matter what subclass you use. Whatever you use this pulse will be a great addition to any vault." |tags:pvp,controller

This works with a build that ability loops by itself like Heart of Inmost Light. If you can keep up Golden Tricorn 2x constantly you will have an incredibly high damage hand cannon. Envious Assassin is an interesting perk as you’ll need to swap off your primary to get kills to overflow your magazine to swap back to your primary.

If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well.

Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with Paracausal Affinity for a 20% damage boost following a kill from any Darkness damage source. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

To improve your gunfeel, in the first trait slot as you r support perk, Perpetual Motion adds a decent bump to handling, stability and reload speed, or if you want extra range then Keep Away boosts that, reload speed and accuracy. Osmosis, as your signature perk in the second trait column is fairly rare and will pick up any of the energy synergies from your subclass (say, volatile rounds when that's procced by a void ability) - if you haven't already got a pulse rifle with the perk, then this would be worth hanging on to.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and burst damage to Majors in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. In the first trait column Envious Assassin can give you up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon, but Field Prep, Threat Detector or Stats for All are all worth considering as a support perk. Void subclasses provide a great toolkit to trigger the second stack of Golden Tricorn for 50% bonus damage, in the second trait column for your signature perk.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently (as at v7.0.0.6) in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much). As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

Handling is the standard play for shotguns, so Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling are your best choices.

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling (and boost reload speed too). Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Stasis synergy in general activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further. To pair with your Stasis aspects and fragments, Headstone is your choice for signature perk in the second trait column.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL.

With one eye towards building a weapon around Voltshot (this is the first GL with Voltshot as an option, although the jury is still out on whether that's a good idea or not) as the signature perk in the second trait column, we'll need to make the reload as fast as possible. High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too.

Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your pick of the support perks, Auto-Loading Holster lets you empty the magazine and reload while you're swapped to your DPS special weapon to rinse and repeat, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot.

This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage. We've seen rapid-fire shotguns a lot - you'll need to be careful to to be in a vulnerable position when using one, but they're useful for bursting down a major or champion once stunned. With one eye on One-Two Punch in the second trait column, Full Choke gives you the best chance of hitting your target with every pellet, and Tactical Mag is easily the best of the mag perks. Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too, and One-Two Punch adds additional multiplicative melee damage (even if it's been nerfed somewhat) to burst down a major, or even a boss. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE although you'll probably not be seeing them often on a Boss-damaging weapon.

// Iterative Loop (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with rapid kills - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8. In the second trait column, Explosive Payload adds a flat 15% bonus damage or, in a fireteam, Firing Line adds 20% crit damage.

In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major.

First-choice PvE roll for end-game content. Pretty decent, in-bands stats, so Smallbore offers a little extra range and stability, both of which are useful boosts. To take full advantage of Target Lock, to burst down beefier minors, look for as large a magazine as you can and combine with Fourth Time's the Charm. This could be a little niche, but this roll with Lodbrok could be a useful tool to have in your loadout if you're facing constructs and vehicles, with the Hakke Breach Armaments' 15% damage boost on top of Target Lock.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of using fire and forget in PvP. It’s kind of a mixed bag. It can definitely feel good and has some forgiveness you don’t really find on heavy weapons. I like aggressive bursts for PvP but I don’t find myself reaching for them often. Maybe a crafted version will change that. Go for as low of a charge time with as high handling and as much range you can fit into this wonderfully sexy weapon. Rangefinder will help keep aim assist at range, and high-impact reserves will help if you miss part of the burst." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP lightweight bows are not the strongest choice. You can definitely make them work in either a swap build or by team-shooting with them.

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue.

I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks.

[...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Unfortunately for Prolonged Engagement it won’t see a lot of use outside of PvE. Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling.

With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75.

title:WarlockMaggie's Season 19, Dawning Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Similar to my PvP recommendation, stability needs to be your priority but you can mix in range to get a bit more accuracy. Steady Rounds plus a Range MW provides that mix with a little extra Airborne Effectiveness to help you get the jump on your opponents. Combine that with a tried and true consistency combo of Tap the Trigger and Rangefinder, this will work for you if you put in the work of finding this roll.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2812100428&perks=124408337,744594675

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Encore got a rework this season and it works well with Desperado as any missed precision final blows will still increase the range, stability and accuracy of the weapon (5, 8, and 1.25% / stack, up to 4 stacks). With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist. Either way, the lightweight frame will additionally give you a little boost in movement speed which may help you take cover from that Chaos Reach that just showed up.

// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Nothing beats the holiday whimsy of disintegrating your enemies in a void-powered explosion, getting a round auto-loaded, and then doing it all over again :) Glacioclasm hits hard, but it also handles like a brick. Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel. A Reload MW and the Omolon intrinsic trait will help make the rare time you need to reload not take an ice age. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I’m not going to dissuade anyone from taking this into the Crucible, but bear in mind that pre-charging your shot is crucial to success with this archetype.

// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent. Avalanche takes Arrowhead quite nicely (70 to 100 recoil direction) and Ricochet rounds are my personal go-to for the range and stability bonuses it provides. Give it a try and you’ll see why it is my personal favorite LMG. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Adaptives are my favorite LMG archetype and this extends to use within Crucible. With a requirement of 5 crits to achieve the coveted .53s TTK, accuracy is going to be vital: enter DSR + Tap the Trigger. With DSR taking 0.6 seconds to fully ramp up, you will likely be near maximum benefit by that 5th shot. Like Hammerhead and other 450 rpm LMGs after it, this can catch many a Guardian by surprise and melt them quickly! Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Couple it with Duelist’s Trance for extra stats. It’s a chilling prospect to consider… Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Okay, hear me out on this combo. It’s a unique one to the Adaptive frame sword archetype and what it allows is the ability to steal the overshield of a supering Guardian and apply it to yourself while dealing increased damage. This could mean you can easily shut down roaming, ground-based supers and survive the opposing team’s retribution. Otherwise, it’s just like any other sword in the Crucible (that doesn’t have Eager Edge). Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Smallbore and Flared are both going to provide minor buffs to stability which will be felt massively on a gun with a base of 7. Plus a little extra reload to help Frenzy along is never a bad thing, so Flared is a no brainer for me. Frenzy is fairly obvious, damage boost + reload boost baked into the same perk is really nice. Unrelenting may not be everyone's first pick, but for me, this gun feels like a mobbing monster, getting healing inside that same role is just a cherry on top. MW Unimportant|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): While the main traits are obvious picks as far as this weapon is concerned, the rest is a little confusing. With a base 7 stability, will full sending into the stat actually make a meaningful difference? Will losing it entirely via Full Bore make a difference? I honestly don't know. I will be looking for these rolls because they're a great middle ground with a little extra stability for controllers. I do believe the rolls are interchangeable though, since it's just a MW difference. Recommended MW: Range (M+KB), Stability (Controller)|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Lightweight pulses are feeling a lot better in PvP these days and for me, Killing Wind and Kill Clip are perks that perfectly compliment each other and provide so many benefits to the gun it becomes a no brainer. With 55 Recoil Direction, Arrowhead Brake is a must on Stay Frosty and High-Caliber should assist in opening duels to get KW/KC rolling. Omolon Fluid Dynamics will make up for any stability or reload speed losses meaning you can get the extra little bit of range from the MW. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): This weapon is a High-Impact. You can try to skirt that fact with lower charge times, but it will still charge slow and hit hard as long as you're accurate. I say embrace it and full send into consistency. Corrected recoil direction, higher stability, better accuracy while under fire. Which you inevitably will be with a High-Impact. Unlike PvE, I don't feel the attempt at lowering charge time is worth it. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=1820235745,4293542123

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This one is tricky. I wanted to look for Thresh and Chain Reaction, but Half Truths can get that same roll and it would be enhanced via crafting. So it's necessary to commit to the thing only this sword can do, and that's Cold Steel. I figured Cold Steel and Wellspring would be a nice combo for any hyper aggressive Stasis builds.

I personally would never take this sword into PvP, but if I absolutely had to I'd likely end up using my heavy to fight supers, which would never result in me escaping unscathed so unrelenting might help? Maybe? In any case, Cold Steel is doing nothing for you in PvP, which is the only thing that makes this sword unique. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For duelling, you don't really need to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger which together add stability and accuracy through your volley.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b).

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed - this should help with sniping too. For snipers you generally want to boost Handling with the barrel. In the mag, there's not an awful lot to help out, but Alloy Mag helps with reloads, and Flared Magwell does that too, and improves stability to help a bit with flinch. For kill-chaining Snapshot Sights gets you into the very reasonable ADS zoom of 45 quickly, and if you can proc Swashbuckler x5, you can one-shot body at any resilience, so keep going for as long as you've got ammo.  Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, MKB, Controller

// (Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), Assault Mag, Slideshot, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

// Trustee (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Puglist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for melee builds. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag). For melee builds, Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the natural choice - get a melee kill for a refreshable 33% damage boost, and then each hit regenerates a little melee energy from the origin trait, while each kill regenerates a full 10%.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod). If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage.

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s (12s with the Enhanced Perk) for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury.

description:Reprised King's Fall weapons with Runneth Over origin trait

// Doom of Chelchis (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable.  First-choice PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload (at 180 RPM) and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight.

// Midha's Reckoning (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), Dynamic Sway Reduction, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for kill chaining. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. It's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column, which pairs with the Omolon origin trait to keep your bullets on target through the magazine, and Golden Tricorn is the best damage perk - one stack gets you to the 0.6s TTK and two stacks to 0.47s with 6 crits and 2 body shots. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Targeting Adjustor, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Roads, Rapid Hit, Box Breathing
//notes:First choice PvP roll for duelling. Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience (2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK) and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit in the first trait column helps further with Stability (as well as a Reload Speed boost) Recommended MW: Handling, with a Full Auto Retrofit mod, Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duelling, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “In PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Ammit AR2 is a fantastic feeling auto rifle, held back by the fact it is an auto rifle. Arrowhead brake is almost a must to max out that recoil direction.

Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play.

// Doom of Chelchis (Harrowed)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Scout Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

It will lose value as you start shooting, but that is where something like dynamic sway reduction or threat detector could come in to make it easier to shoot.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload or Charge Time “Taipan-4fr is incredible for what it is. it is a craftable linear fusion rifle with perks that compare and get it close to things like Reed's Regret and Stormchaser. It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you do not play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options. Rapid hit makes it easier to land consecutive crits, clown cartridge will overflow your magazine, and if you can remember to crouch field prep will be your best option for reserves and a fast reload.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Whistler's Whim (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Accuracy “In PvP kill clip alone will not be able to one shot every resilience of guardian, but with radiant or an empowering rift, or really any other damage bonus you will be able to. In a team setting you should call out anyone with this bow just on the off-chance someone else is running Lumina or an empowering rift. It will be efficient with a team, but fall off in solo-play.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Bow Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “PvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I do not see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.  Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Sprint Grip, Quick Access Sling, Freehand Grip (or Icarus Grip if you're serious about aerial use) mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Elemental Capacitor
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for duelling, to tuck away just in case, you might as well add to range with barrel and mag, and then make it more controllable with Dynamic Sway Reduction and Elemental Capacitor with a Void subclass. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB

// Polygonal Rifling, Steady Rounds, Pugilist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

// Brigand's Law (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Accurized Rounds, (Hip-Fire Grip, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion), (Swashbuckler, Surrounded)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The first Tex Mechanica legendary weapon - a lightweight, so it boosts mobility for movement speed. To clear majors, choose a barrel that adds a little to range and/or handling, Tactical Mag for an extra bullet in the magazine or Assault Mag if you miss a pellet. Then, Pugilist and the Hot Swap origin perk help boost handling, while lightweights still fire fast enough to take advantage of the 50% damage buff from Trench Barrel.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox. Unfortunately, Danger Zone has been lost in its re-issued format, so there's no complementary trait in the last column. You'll be swapping back and forth, so go for a handling barrel. Obviously Blinding Grenades in the mag, and then Auto-Loading Holster to reload while you're mopping up your blinded enemies with your Energy weapon. As there's not that much in the second column of traits, but if you do manage to catch an add or two, you might as well try to get some ability energy out of it.

Aggressive frame submachine guns aren’t exactly the easiest to use on controllers, but MnK can really leverage its strengths.

A good combination for grenade centered builds will be demolitionist and adrenaline junkie, but if you happen to find yourself on a more neutral void subclass then you might like golden tricorn.

Unfortunately it is the true master of one. Having both adrenaline junkie and demolitionist really elevate it with grenade builds on Void 3.0 or some Solar 3.0 builds, but I would rather have either a dedicated “big-deeps” machine gun or an add clear machine gun with firefly or dragonfly. I don’t really find myself using machine guns for add clearing, but having a very reliable weapon for grenade builds is never a bad option.

// The Hero's Burden
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "PvP is where this weapon will sing. Kill clip and feeding frenzy are still both great for Crucible purposes. I know a decent number of players will go for iron reach to hit that coveted 20-21m effective range. Neither are bad options but I would rate ricochet rounds higher over high-caliber rounds when using iron reach for that touch of stability. On the other hand high-caliber rounds will help you win those 1v1 situations to proc kill clip." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

The two most important factors for deep OHK on a fusion are zoom followed by stability. Because the Wizened Rebuke cannot roll rangefinder, the next best thing is to invest into stability to make sure that all the bolts hit.

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Where I’ve heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura’s Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid. Keep an eye out for this one." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,controller

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lunulata-4b is a great alternative in the kinetic slot. The clear choice is to pair it with any of the stasis builds, and you’d be absolutely correct. Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option. (though you could always craft a Fel Taradiddle)." Recommended MW - Draw Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Unfortunately my enthusiasm doesn’t extend to PvP. [...] Lightweight bows just don’t feel as strong as their precision brethren. To make the most of Lunulata-4b you’ll want to drop the draw time down to the floor. Rangefinder doesn’t do a ton to make the arrows more hit-scan or extend your range by a ton, but it does make those longer shots feel a bit more sticky and successful warm-up will make follow up kills easier to manage."

// Gallu RR3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Gallu RR3 feels like a waste. The best mag increasing perk is overflow, which I have clear history loving. And focused fury is incredible when reloaded into a full mag. But when you already have strong options like Thoughtless, The Long Shadow, Uzume RR4, and Fugue-55 competing for the same slot, and the IKELOS_SR_v1.0.2 or Praedyth’s Revenge being the best snipers for damage. It’s hard to recommend a new sniper that does everything the former sniper’s do but less." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Gallu RR3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Snipers in PvP are incredibly personal, so if you find yourself looking for a lower zoom sniper and don’t have a Beloved, 1000 Yard Stare, Fugue-55, or any other archetype of sniper you like, the Gallu RR3 is here to try. It does have a low 40 zoom. But I know a lot of players have already moved back to 50 zoom and will be staying there for the foreseeable future." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] Staccato-46 does come brimming with great Solar 3.0 synergy. Incandescent and triple tap or outlaw are fantastic together to spread scorch.

// Firefright
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Similar to a lot of weapons this season, Firefright suffers from its frame, not its perks. Threat detector and elemental capacitor both are incredible on any weapon and adagio on a precision frame feels really fun to use. Because of vanilla D2 and the usage of Uriel’s Gift and other precision frame auto rifles, the current day auto rifles have the worst optimal and body shot TtK, resulting in lukewarm results at best, and at worst, not an enjoyable experience."

// Without Remorse
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Without Remorse is an interesting shotgun. It competes with everyone’s favorite Seventh Seraph CQC-12. Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on. Having a 200% damage increase to your non-ranged melee is incredibly fun for destroying majors or chunky red bars. Pair that with auto-loading holster to keep your mag topped off is the way to go."

// Without Remorse
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Where things get a lot closer is in the crucible. A very common perk combo to run in order to max out handling is via threat detector and elemental capacitor on arc. The Seventh Seraph CQC-12 has a different but equally effective max handling combination in snapshot and quickdraw. Depending on how you play I think the winner will be decided that way. If you enjoy arc subclasses, Without Remorse is the reigning champion. If you play almost any other subclass, the Seventh Seraph CQC-12 is the best in slot."

Masterwork: Range, with an Adept Range mod to push range out to 100, a Sprint Grip or Quick Access Sling, if you're playing aggressively, an Adept Icarus Grip mod to build on the already good Airborne Effectiveness stat, or a Targeting Adjustor for more passive playstyles.|tags: pvp, pvp-duel, controller

Shoot to Loot gives valuable ammo pickup from cover, and Explosive Payload adds flinch, damage, stunning overload champions and slightly extends the ammo pickup area when shooting near bricks.

There are much better sniper rifles out there (TBH, you should really just go and buy Adored from the Tower Exotic Kiosk), But if you're pushed, then you can make this a decent choice for short damage windows against majors. Improve Handling/Stability with the barrel, and maximise the magazine size to seven with appended mag and a Backup Mag mod. Overflow doubles this to 14 when you pick up ammo.

title:u/pandapaxxy's Guardian Games 2022 breakdown

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB / Controller / PvE): "The Title is an interesting SMG. It's got some great synergy with different builds like the All for All, or grave robber and swashbuckler. Vorpal is always a good choice for general use, but I find SMGs can't really take advantage of it. If you have a good Funnelweb, you can make this work with different builds, but for overall usage I don't know if I'd take The Title over my frenzy Funnelweb."

// Insidious
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Similar to PvE if you can control the recoil you can opt for not having arrowhead brake, but I would highly recommend it. Base range is 77 which puts you at 38m in-game. Pushing that out can get you comfortably past the extremes of hand cannons. Rapid hit also keeps your bursts consistent at those ranges which can keep your TtK low. I’d also recommend adrenaline junkie for the bonuses to handling and any damage boost just makes your two burst easier.". Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. [...] Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing.

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "This is a fun situation where PvE and PvP mix. Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The “big” damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don’t lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades. Truthfully I’d try and make this weapon as consistent as physically possible and spec fully into stability.

Le Monarche just got a wonderful catalyst in unrelenting, so you could potentially have a legendary lemon through dragonfly and unrelenting together.

// Perses-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "High-impact scouts have a weird spot within the crucible sandbox. With Vostok and Eternity coming back it allows some more long ranged options to dominate PvP. But Perses lacks in the two departments I want; ideally it would be snappy and have good stability to make my side easier in long range. You can fully send into handling and stability to offset the lower base stats, but you can’t go half way with it. Steady rounds on a scout rifle isn’t the worst idea because of the weapon types inherent range, so the loss of range really won’t hurt it either. Perpetual motion and either explosive payload or opening shot are the ideal perks to go really incentivise good crucible habits and make your shooting experience better, but if you don’t feel like moving around a lot you can opt for rapid hit instead to stay firmly planted at B flag."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvE there are just better shotguns, where a neutral, high-handling weapon just will not fit the bill.

[...] Crucible is where Reckless Endangerment can really flex [...] Having a shotgun that you don’t really have to invest in to make it feel fluid gives new players and people uncomfortable with PvP a shotgun to compete with. The obvious comparison is Riiswalker and I do think Riiswalker takes the cake over Reckless Endangerment in all forms of PvP.

// Fortissimo-11
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Much like Reckless Endangerment, I do think Fortissimo-11 will find better success in the crucible. With access to two of the best PvP perks it will easily find a home as a legendary contender to Chaperone, or a Heritage alternative. Threat detector and opening shot alone are enough to make it competitive. Add in some niche builds like adrenaline junkie and demolitionist for easy one shot body kills, or some more passive perks like moving target and perpetual motion to bring up the low aim assist and better the feel.".

In most cases that is entirely a meme, but against specific bosses it could be useful to have. A more utilitarian roll would be triple tap with vorpal weapon to slot in adept big ones when the grandmaster nightfalls release.

// Father's Sins
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Lower zoom snipers did just get a small buff to their aim assist cones, and Father’s Sins is a 35 zoom sniper. That being said, it doesn’t immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father’s Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard’s Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper. Time will tell, but it wouldn’t hurt to keep one around.". Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Unfortunately this sniper does not compete in PvE compared to other snipers. I wouldn’t be using a sniper to clear rank-and-file enemies. And I wouldn’t use this sniper for boss damage. It does have Triple Tap and Demolitionist for faster mag dumps, but being an adaptive frame means it sits in the middle of burst damage and sustained damage."

// 1000 Yard Stare
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvP): "I do not know why everyone is so hyped by Quickdraw and Snapshot Sights on the 1kys. Quickdraw only works when you swap to the weapon with it, and goes away when you aim down sights or 1 second (whatever happens first). Unless you’re going for style points hot swapping to this sniper for montages the better choice is Firmly Planted. Firmly Planted increases accuracy and handling when crouched and activates on a slide. You do not have to stay crouched for it to be activated and could even crouch mid-gunfight for all the bonuses."

//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "This is probably the best thing to come this season. It’s an incredible design. A second spin-to-win sword and comes with Chain Reaction? Heck yeah! Arguably One for All is going to be better on this sword as you can spin in a group and instantly get full stacks. BUT sword go boom? Sword go boom. I’m excited."

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind. You could definitely opt for some of the other perks here too as nothing really screams PvE."|tags:pve,controller

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "For PvP I really value Rangefinder. It would give it the competitive edge over guns like Thorn or Ace and increase Hawkmoon’s already stellar consistency. If you don’t like the increased Zoom then something like Snapshot Sights really makes Hawkmoon feel snappy. You also can’t go wrong with Eye of the Storm, Opening Shot, or Killing Wind."|tags:pvp,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."

// Last Perdition (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good controller) - "[...] Last Perdition is basically Bygones but Void, with sights instead of barrels! [...] slightly better stability, and slightly worse range and recoil direction."

// Black Scorpion-4sr (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good controller) - "Outside of Bygones, this is actually my favorite primary weapon."

// False Promises
//notes: (PvP / Controller): Mercules904 (pretty good PvP/controller) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pvp,controller
