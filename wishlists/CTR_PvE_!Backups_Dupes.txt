// Live Fire
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Live Fire doesn't do anything spectacular, but it's not trying to reinvent the wheel. Live Fire exists to specialize in Stasis. While it's nothing fancy it doesn't have to be. Shoot to Loot is interesting if you make crystals through your subclass (Prismatic or Stasis). Or it can be a generic scout rifle through Subsistence or Rapid Hit." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Neoptolemus II
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Ah yes. Nepotism the bow. What an interesting selection of perks. Not a single good reload perk through Rapid Hit or Archer's Tempo. You could go all 360-no-scope-Legolas-lite with Perfect Float and Air Trigger. But in reality this bow is more for ability regeneration. Pugilist or Strategist giving melee or class ability energy, respectively. Add in Wellspring for general ability energy and you've got a real quick way of getting your abilities back."

// Legato-11
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Legato-11 seems to be Bungie’s answer to an updated FILO. Auto-Loading Holster and Cascade Point for almost Fourth Horseman like DPS or Focused Fury and Triple Tap for improved total damage. Incandescent and Heal Clip also synergize for Solar or any build really. It's kind of like a jack of all trades but keeps itself unique enough to not be a master of none."

// VS Gravitic Arrest
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "VS Gravatic Arrest has some steep competition. Royal Executioner, Techeun Force, Pressurized Precision, heck even Trinary System. Does Withering Gaze do enough to give it a spot in your loadout? Well it does apply the Weaken debuff for the low low cost of one ammo. That alone for any damage rotation will be highly helpful. It doesn't do anything flashy like double damage perks or infinite ammo, but it does make dealing damage easier. If you're not hurting for vault space then I would recommend grabbing one, otherwise it's a wash and you can apply Weaken through other means." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh boy, did I not expect to see another Adaptive Frame auto rifle. We just got Khvostov, Summoner, and Ros Arago IV. And all those weapons are strong within their own right. VS Pyroelectric Propellent has one trick up its sleeve and that's Jolting Feedback. You can pair this with Attrition Orbs for some extra orb generation, or Eddy Current for faster reload when Amplified. The other weapons fit into their specific elemental roles and that applies here too. The more you like Arc the more this weapon shines." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// VS Velocity Baton
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This is probably my favorite weapon to come out of this dungeon. The amount of orbs you can generate is almost as strong as OG Tether back in Year 1 Eater of Worlds. Lorathexplorer almost crashed my game multiple times with how many orbs she made. For general use Attrition Orbs is great but I feel the perk interaction is slightly unintended. You do have the Void Synergy, but outside of that it is a nice area denial frame for the energy slot versus the kinetic." Recommended MW: Blast Radius or Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fair Judgment
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Our newest Ritual Weapon is Fair Judgement. A stasis auto rifle that has pretty low to medium tier stats across the board. Its uniqueness comes from being only the second precision frame stasis auto rifle. The other being last year's Horror Story that was dropped from the recently concluded Festival of the Lost. Rimestealer and Headstone are both fantastic together for stasis synergy and even outside of stasis to build up Frost Armor stacks." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Exuviae
//notes:pandapaxxy & WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[pandapaxxy] Rimestealer might just be one of the best perks to bless Stasis since the original Headstone. Rimestealer allows you to build Frost Armor which is incredibly useful in all activities. Extra damage resistance? We all remember changed with light giving damage resistance. It was the norm and it was odd when not used (outside of Warmind Cells). Definitely look for Rimestealer on your Exuviae. [WarlockMaggie] While Handcannons aren’t supported by Episode II’s Artifact, this Stasis 120 does provide some excellent options for both General and Advanced level play. The new hotness of Rimestealer and Headstone is a great option, while Stats for All and Frenzy will make this weapon feel incredible without a single kill required. Stability and Reload are high priorities for stat increases." Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It's no secret I absolutely love Stasis weapons and to get a double-fire launcher is exciting!

// Insurmountable
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Insurmountable looks to be a decent Void sidearm for most activities. The issue is most sidearms don't scare up to GM levels easily.

Just please don't take it into any real high power level activities." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Explosive Payload will give you a slight damage bump and apply Weaken with Withering Gaze. This sniper doesn't really fit the conventional deal of great DPS or single target damage, nor does it “add clear” like other weapons could.

// Vantage Point
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Without a standalone reload perk Vantage Point feels a little lackluster. Keep Away does give a sizable reload boost coupled with a reload MW or loader mods on your gauntlets you can make this weapon feel pretty quick. Stats for All does work with Jolting Feedback to instantly get you to max stacks after applying Jolt which is a nifty trick. Eddy Current’s buff to instantly apply the benefits when amplified is great but if you're using Prismatic or just using Jolting Feedback for add clear and aren't investing into Arc you're better off with either of the other perks."

// Arcane Embrace
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Arcane Embrace is the newest frame to Destiny 2. A double fire slug shotgun. Each trigger pull fires two semi-deadly slugs. (Only semi if you can hit your shots). Over in your regular PvE activities it shouldn't matter unless you regularly GM or something. Fourth Times the Charm will give you one extra trigger pull for two consecutive burst crits. Precision Instrument stacks quickly on double fire frames and will work nicely against chunky health bars and champions. Surrounded can work better depending on the encounter and how confident you are at staying alive. Bonus points for Desperado for shotgun go brrrrr."

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Jurassic Green has always been an interesting weapon. It has worse base stats compared to other Rapid-Fire frame pulse rifles. Even with the deterministic recoil I preferred the base recoil with counterbalance or full send to 100 recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. Heal Clip and Incandescent are tried and true rolls but you could opt for Frenzy for the big boost to reload and handling. Loose Change with Incandescent can also make you forget about the reload stat, but falls off a bit in higher level content." Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Mechabre has always been a great sniper rifle. Even though High-Impact snipers aren't high meta their high single shot damage is great for solo play or short damage phases where accuracy isn't as important. Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge will get you better ammo with Appended Mag and a backup mag mod. If you're going to be with fireteam members, Firing Line is best in slot. Vorpal Weapon is second best but better for solo or dual fireteams." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Acosmic is back and better than ever. Clown Cartridge and any of your favorite damage perks is going to be the roll to get. Impulse Amplifier is also good if you don't remember to reload before damage phases. Air Trigger can get you back to back mags with ease. I would say that Withering Gaze is not the perk to get.

/// Legato-11 (PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Triple Tap, Auto-Loading Holster), (Vorpal Weapon, Frenzy, Focused Fury)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for backup sustained Boss special weapon damage in general, and end-game underleveled content. There was a time when slug shotties like Legato-11 were the meta for CQC Boss damage. They're still decent, mind, and it wouldn't take much of a buff for their glory days to return. At base the stats are very good - 65 Range equates to 9.22m while ADS and 7.69m hipfire, 68 Handling is 0.32s ready speed, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 48 is a 0.72s reload per shell. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 19/20/22/23 shots (maximum is 23) and magazine size of 6 (maximum is 8). Slug SGs have the same vertical recoil boost as Precisions, so you can largely ignore recoil direction, and use the barrel perk to boost Handling. You have options for the magazine perk - Assault Mag increases your fire rate, and thus DPS. You can hit the maximum mag size of 8 with either Tactical Mag (which also boosts Stability and Reload Speed) or Appended Mag and a Backup Mag mod. Or you can boost Range and Reload Speed with Light Mag. For sustained boss damage, you can go one of two ways - Triple Tap will let you shoot 12 times before reloading with the max mag size of 8, or Auto-Loading Holster lets you swap to a kinetic slot slug SG continue DPS while it reloads in the background. For a damage perk, Vorpal Weapon or Frenzy (which also maxes out Handling and Reload Speed when procced) boost damage by ×1.15, or Focused Fury can provide ×1.2 damage after you've hit crits with your first four shots. The Suros Synergy origin trait only procs after a manual reload, but it's always nice to have extra handling.

Live Fire is a decent stasis scout rifle, if you're looking for one, offering better integration with the Stasis verb toolkit than previous versions. At base the stats are decent (except for maybe Reload Speed) - 45 Range equates to 74.61m while ADS and 37.31m hipfire, 46 Handling is 0.41s ready speed, 0.33s ADS speed and 0.39s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 40 is a 2.18s reload. With this being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the recoil direction stat, and use the barrel perk to boost Handling. Look for Reload Speed-bosting mag perks, although Armor-Piercing Rounds is another utility option for your vault for when scout rifles have the seasonal artefact anti-barrier mod, for a ×1.05 damage boost to shields and barriers. For Stasis synergy, the combination of Rimestealer and Headstone gives you Stasis crystals on crit kills, and Frost Armor stacks when you shatter them for AoE damage, which you can use fragments to enhance further. The Field Forged origin trait does boost gunfeel stats very subtly but, if you can stay alive to keep collecting stacks, you will start feeling the benefit at higher tiers as you rack up hits and kills. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create more Stasis shards or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Veleda-F (first-choice PvE)

Veleda-F is, hopefully, a harbinger future void snipers that we can consider in a fireteam's loadout for major and boss damage, even though aggressive frames aren't the optimal choice for damage. At base the stats are average - 47 Zoom, 80 Range, 30 Handling is 0.43s ready speed, 0.44s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 27 is a 3.26s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 21/23/24/25 shots (max is 27) and magazine size of 3 (maximum 5). Both Handling and Reload Speed could do with a little help with barrel and magazine perks, although there's also something to be said for a larger capacity mag too. Air Trigger in the first trait perk column provides the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced) for more total ammo and, if you can co-ordinate starting reloading during a jump, adds 30 to Reload Speed and a ×0.8 reload animation duration. Withering Gaze in the second column applies the same weaken debuff as Divinity - effectively a ×1.15 boost to damage for 6s for the whole fireteam, so could be used in combination with a Boss damage heavy weapon. Interestingly, you can also extend the timer of sources of 30% weaken, such as Felwinter's Helm and Tractor Cannon (but not Hunter Tethers unfortunately) by using Withering Gaze to reapply the debuff. Hopefully in future we'll see the trait in the first column of a sniper rifle. If you're interested, Veleda was a priestess and prophet of the Bructeri Germanic tribe during the Batavian rebellion against Rome in 69–70 CE. The Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait increases damage against vehicles (×1.15), constructs (×1.3) and Stasis crystals (×1.45), which can be situationally useful.

Fair Judgment is a decent stasis auto rifle, if you're looking for one, offering better integration with the Stasis verb toolkit than previous versions. At base the stats are solid - 59 Range equates to 29.00m while ADS and 08.13m hipfire, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready speed, 0.31s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 43 is a 1.92s reload. With this being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the recoil direction stat. Corkscrew Rifling adds a little bit of everything as the barrel perk, and Armor-Piercing Rounds is decent option to overpenetrate targets and a ×1.05 damage boost to shields and barriers - useful for when the anti-barrier seasonal artifact mod's around. For Stasis synergy, the combination of Rimestealer and Headstone gives you Stasis crystals on crit kills, and Frost Armor stacks when you shatter them for AoE damage, which you can use fragments to enhance further. The origin trait options of Vanguard Vindication, for a small health bump on a kill, or One Quiet Moment for +20 Handling, +40 Reload Speed with a ×0.95 reload animation duration when out of combat are both useful. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create more Stasis shards or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// BrayTech Werewolf
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Braytech Werewolf is the sole survivor of the two FotL auto rifle conundrum we've had. Poor Horror Story (though whether it's a glitch or not, you can enhance your old FotL weapons…SGA). When using Braytech Werewolf in PvE your best roll is Rewind Rounds or Subsistence paired with your choice of Onslaught or Kinetic Tremors. It entirely depends on how you would like to use this auto. All 4 perks are great on their own and make this auto feel incredible." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Arcane Embrace
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Arcane Embrace is the newest frame to Destiny 2. A double fire slug shotgun. Each trigger pull fires two semi-deadly slugs. (Only semi if you can hit your shots). Over in your regular PvE activities it shouldn't matter unless you regularly GM or something. Fourth Times the Charm will give you one extra trigger pull for two consecutive burst crits. Precision Instrument stacks quickly on double fire frames and will work nicely against chunky health bars and champions. Surrounded can work better depending on the encounter and how confident you are at staying alive. Bonus points for Desperado for shotgun go brrrrr."

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Jurassic Green has always been an interesting weapon. It has worse base stats compared to other Rapid-Fire frame pulse rifles. Even with the deterministic recoil I preferred the base recoil with counterbalance or full send to 100 recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. Heal Clip and Incandescent are tried and true rolls but you could opt for Frenzy for the big boost to reload and handling. Loose Change with Incandescent can also make you forget about the reload stat, but falls off a bit in higher level content." Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Mechabre has always been a great sniper rifle. Even though High-Impact snipers aren't high meta their high single shot damage is great for solo play or short damage phases where accuracy isn't as important. Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge will get you better ammo with Appended Mag and a backup mag mod. If you're going to be with fireteam members, Firing Line is best in slot. Vorpal Weapon is second best but better for solo or dual fireteams." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Acosmic is back and better than ever. Clown Cartridge and any of your favorite damage perks is going to be the roll to get. Impulse Amplifier is also good if you don't remember to reload before damage phases. Air Trigger can get you back to back mags with ease. I would say that Withering Gaze is not the perk to get. It's solid on special weapons and even though it's new it doesn't work well with the best in slot perk, Bait and Switch. If you can lead with Withering Gaze on another weapon you can swap to Acosmic for huge damage numbers." Recommended MW: Blast Radius.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

BrayTech Werewolf returns for 2024 with a couple of new tricks, and its previous good stats. At base, 69 Range equates to 31.00m while ADS and 19.38m hipfire, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready speed, 0.32 ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 42 is a 1.94s reload. Being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the Recoil Direction stat, and use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or Stability, and pretty much any mag will do (except Extended) - so very much personal preference. For general add-clearing, the trait perk pairing of Rewind Rounds compliments Onslaught to passively refill your mag as you hit adds and reach the higher damage stacks. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced.

// Arcane Embrace (first-choice PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Alloy Mag), Fourth Time's the Charm, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 121 from 5 November 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/64p7wnHATJnZB8jnnJUnhP?si=f5552155425a4d6a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for backup sustained Boss damage in general and end-game, underleveled, content. Arcane Embrace is the first of a new subfamily of Heavy Burst shotguns, which look like they might be the new top pick for special weapon boss DPS, doing 9.88% more damage that slug shotguns if both shits hit. The stats look similar to Pin Point Slug shotties too, and by that standard are pretty decent. At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 26/29/33/34, but you can chew through ammo fast, firing two shots with each trigger pull. The usual play for shotguns of boosting handling with the barrel perk still applies and, as there's no Assault Mag, look to a magazine perk that helps with Reload Speed. For sustained boss damage, once you're out of heavy ammo, the perk trait combination of Fourth Time's the Charm and Precision Instrument, if you can consistently hit a boss crit spot to take advantage of the up to ×1.25 boost to precision damage and extend your mag. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced.

Void rapid-fire grenade launcher Acosmic returns with a couple of new tricks for a boss damage. The stats look decent out of the box. At base, 25 Handling translates to 0.48s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.43 stow speed, and with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 33/35/37/38 shots. For boss damage, Hard Launch as the barrel perk squeezes a tiny bit more damage out of Spike Grenades, but otherwise look for one that boosts velocity. Air Trigger may sound like a weird recommendation for the first trait perk, but it's more for the additional reserves - equivalent to 1.5 reserve mods (2 mods when enhanced) and, as long as you start your reload animation while in the air, the whole reload will be sped up. You'll need a fast reload to use with Bait and Switch for the ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced, but don't overlook Nadir Focus for extra velocity. If you're interested, Acosmic is named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense (according to Merriam-Webster).

// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), Appended Mag, (Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge, Air Trigger), (Firing Line, Vorpal Weapon)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss enemies in end-game content. Mechabre (it's so obviously a Transformers pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. At base, Handling of 26 equates to 0.44s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.39s stow speed, and Reload Speed of 30 is a 3.20s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 22/24/26/26 of a max total ammo of 27. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk, and then Appended Mag with a Backup Mag mod gets you to the maximum of 5 in the mag. If you don't have a well-rolled rapid-fire sniper for backup boss damage, you could start in the first trait perk slot with one of Triple Tap (7 crits before reload), Clown Cartridge (6-8 shots before reload), or Air Trigger to boost Reload Speed by +30 when you start the reload animation off the ground and boost total ammo by the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced). Combine one of those with Firing Line for a ×1.2 damage boost in a fireteam or Vorpal Weapon for a flat ×1.15 boost to majors and bosses in the second. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

Look for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and/or Handling together with Spike Grenades as the magazine perk. For burst damage, Clown Cartridge in the first trait perk column lets you take full advantage of Explosive Light's up to 6 shots (7 when enhanced) of ×1.25 bonus damage just for picking up power orbs, in the second.

VS Gravitic Arrest is the first ever legendary void adaptive FR in D2 so, if you've been yearning for one, your wait is over! The stats are on the low side though. At base, 34 Range equates to 15.73m while ADS and 12.10m hipfire, 30 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.36s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 31 is a 2.27s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, you have 20/23/26/27 total ammo. For the barrel perk, Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel pump up the Handling stat. Enhanced Battery gots you to 7 shots or Ionized Battery provides 8 in as the battery perk. TBH, most of the trait perks are PvP focused, but there''s a nice trait perk synergy between Unrelenting and Chain Reaction - any CR detonation kills count as weapon kills for Unrelenting to help keep you alive in CQC. The Bray Legacy origin trait is useful in PvE, working in the background to add ability energy to the one closest to a full charge on every tick of weapon damage.

VS Pyroelectric Propellant is funky-looking arc adaptive auto-rifle with very decent stats. At base, 42 Range equates to 25.60m while ADS, 60 Handling is 0.35s ready, 0.28s ADS speed and 0.32s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 50 is a 1.81s reload. To be honest, you'll be good with pretty much any barrel and magazine perk combination (except maybe Full Bore) - play into your own preferences. If you are looking towards the new-to-season-25 Jolting Feedback trait perk in the second column though, larger magazines work well - you might be able to apply Jolt to three targets before you need to reload. For arc builds, you can pair this with Eddy Current in the first column for gunfeel boosts while Amplified. Jolting Feedback is a great end-game trait perk, applying Jolt on the 16th bullet (12 when Amplified) - and one fewer (15 and 11) when Enhanced - and not requiring a kill to proc. Maybe pair with Sparks of Amplitude, Ions and Discharge or Facets of Awakening and Purpose to synergise with arc builds. The Bray Legacy origin trait is useful in PvE, working in the background to add ability energy to the one closest to a full charge on every tick of weapon damage.

VS Gravitic Arrest is the first ever legendary void adaptive FR in D2 so, if you've been yearning for one, your wait is over! The stats are on the low side though. At base, 34 Range equates to 15.73m while ADS and 12.10m hipfire, 30 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.36s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 31 is a 2.27s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, you have 20/23/26/27 total ammo. For the barrel perk, Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel pump up the Handling stat. Enhanced Battery gots you to 7 shots or Ionized Battery provides 8 in as the battery perk. TBH, most of the trait perks are PvP focused, but there''s a nice trait perk synergy between Demolitionist and Chain Reaction - you'll get 20% (22% when enhanced) grenade energy from Chain Reaction kills, and then use your grenade for an instant reload.

VS Velocity Baton is the only second Area Denial GL if you 've been looking for a void flamethrower. The stats look pretty good, with pretty much all stats a little better than Lost Signal. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, you have 24/25/25/25 total ammo. For the barrel and mag perks, look to boost velocity without damaging Blast Radius. You'll likely be looking to Attrition Orbs in the second trait perk column and its ability to print multiple orbs with each shot -  it's not clear yet whether this is bugged and in need of a nerf (but it kinda feels like it might). To pair with that in the first trait column, Demolitionist should get grenade ability back quickly to use as a reload perk, Under-Over should quickly cook non-matching elemental shields and the hidden damage resistance shields of Subjugators, or Unrelenting provides health regeneration. If you have access to void debuffs, Repulsor Brace is another option, to gain Void Overshields.

VS Chill Inhibitor is the first rapid fire Stasis heavy GL. The stats are excellent. At base, 59 Velocity equates to 52.26m/s, 25 Handling is 0.48s ready, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.43s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 29 is a 3.47s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, you have 34/36/38/39 total ammo. For the barrel perk, if you have Spike Grenades as your magazine Perk, Hard Launch squeezes a little extra damage as well as providing the biggest Velocity boost, otherwise Quick Launch and Smart Drift Control also work well. To get the most out of your magazine size, Augmented Drum or Mini Frags are decent magazine perk alternatives. The trait perk pairing of Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch both proc on the same condition of damaging a target with your other weapons to reload the mag, and boost damage by ×1.3 for 10s.

Exuviae is only the second Stasis aggressive hand cannon and, while the stats are pretty much in-band, has a new trick that makes it worth looking at. At base, 61 Range equates to 35.23m while ADS, 32 Handling is 0.38s ready, 0.28s ADS speed and 0.42s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 29 is a 2.46s reload. On controller, you might benefit from some stability from the barrel perk or, if you prefer, focus on handling. You could look to boost Reload Speed with the magazine perk but, if you're willing to play into the Dark Ether origin trait, you'll get value from boosting the magazine size. For Stasis synergy, the new-to-season-25 trait perk Rimestealer is a natural pairing to Headstone - break the stasis crystal generated from a crit kill, or a frozen enemy, to generate a stack of Frost Armor (two stacks when enhanced). The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload. For anyone interested, exuviae are sloughed off natural animal coverings, such as arthropods after they molt.

// Liturgy (first-choice PvE)
// Volatile Launch, Spike Grenades, (Rimestealer, Slideways), (Chill Clip, One for All, Chain Reaction)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 119 from 22 October 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6CEZXurwhqejVZpX506M2a?si=7ef44c5f06ae4412) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways, and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility pick for crowd control in both general and end-game, underleveled content. Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 - that aside, the stats are decent. At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a general purpose crowd control roll, maximise the Blast Radius with Volatile Launch and then, as there's no other magazine perk options that really work, Spike Grenades provides a ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts. As the trait perks, in the first column Rimestealer can work if you have access to other Stasis verbs as part of your build, to generate Frost Armor on frozen enemy kills or stasis crystal shattering, or bypass reloads with Slideways. In the second, Chill Clip pairs well with Rimestealer, One for All procs easily on double-fire GLs for a ×1.35 damage boost, or Chain Reaction adds AoE damage on enemy kills and boosts ammo reserves when enhanced. The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload.

Insurmountable is an arc adaptive Pulse Rifle with overall in-band stats. At base, 42 Range equates to 32.55m when ADS, 40 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.38s ADS speed and 0.41s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 42 is a 2.01s reload. You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size and reload speed. But what makes this weapon special is the combination of Eddy Current to boost reload and handling when procced, and the new-to-season-25 Jolting Feedback trait which will passively apply Jolt to targets after 15 hits on enemies (or 11 when amplified) - great for additional chunk damage on a target and clearing nearby adds with the AoE damage.

Sovereignty is a void adaptive Sniper Rifle with overall in-band stats so, unfortunately it's not as good as a rapid-fire as a backup boss damage weapon. At base, it has 45 Zoom, 40 Handling which equates to 0.39s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 39 is a 3.04s reload. Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 21/23/25/26. You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size - Appended or Extended Mag with a Backup Mag mod takes total ammo to 25/27/29/30. Combined with the origin trait, you can potentially get 10 in an overflowed mag (13 when the weapon's enhanced). In the second trait perk column is the new-to-season-25 Withering Gaze, which can apply void Weaken global debuff from a safe distance after ADSing for 1.5s (to possibly pair with Echoes of Harvest and Starvation?), for a ×1.15 damage boost while active. There's nothing much that synergises in the first column, so Explosive Payload is tried and trusted for a bit of extra damage, and some flinch. The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload.

Bitter/Sweet is an arc adaptive grenade launcher with decent stats. At base, it has 39 Handling which equates to 0.44s ready, 0.43s ADS speed and 0.40s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 42 is a 3.22s reload. Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 25/27/28/29. For an excellent boss damage roll, boost the Velocity and Handling with the barrel perk, and add Spike Grenades for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts in the magazine. If you lean into the origin trait, this could result in an overflowed magazine of 10 (13 when the weapon is enhanced!). The new-for-season-25 Envious Arsenal in the first trait perk column procs on the same condition as Bait and Switch, so a full weapon damage rotation will reload the base magazine from reserves and provide a further ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. If you can proc the excellent Dark Ether origin trait before DPS starts, you can overflow the magazine by ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced.

// Hard Launch, (Implosion Rounds, Spike Grenades), (Envious Arsenal, Slideways), Chill Clip
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.2 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for a boss damage rotation in both general and end-game, underleveled content, particularly with Stasis builds. Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 (which is actually a plus for this roll), the stats are decent. At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. Counter-intuitively, for single-target damage, the lower the blast radius, the more damage you cause, so reduce the low BR even further with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and Implosion Rounds in the magazine - although Spike Grenades, for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts, is also very good. If you're using this in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation, Envious Arsenal in the first trait column will reload (and also boosts ammo reserves by the equivalent of 1 reserves mod, or 2 when enhanced), or if not, and you're moving between damage plates, Slideways does the same. There's no useful damage perk in the second column, but if you have Chill Clip, then you can use Prismatic's Facet of Courage for a ×1.1 damage multiplier with a light-based heavy weapon or super. You won't get much use from the excellent Dark Ether origin trait from this roll, unfortunately, as it's more about setting up for boss damage than kills.

// Chronophage (first-choice PvE)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), Enhanced Battery, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in end-game content, particularly with void builds. Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17 and, unfortunately its stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Enhanced Battery boosts the total ammo to 456 (508/559/585) and with Backup Mag added gets to 461 (513/565/591). For end-game use, this is the first time the Repulsor Brace + Destabilizing Rounds trait combination has been available on a trace rifle, for clearing add crowds while providing a void overshield to keep safe. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? For anyone interested, the name's derived from Greek words "chronos" and "phage", literally meaning "time-eater" and is used colloquially in French to mean "time-consuming".

Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. Desperate Measures is a really strong second trait column damage perk, providing up to a ×1.3 boost for Guardians that actively use their abilities, and is very easy to proc while transcendent. To pair with that, in the first column, Demolitionist and Pugilist look like natural partners, or if gunfeel is more important to you Threat Detector should be proccing constantly. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. In the first trait perk column, Rapid Hit helps with both recoil control and reload on crit hits, while to boost damage, Kinetic Tremors is good for a bit of flinch and AoE damage after 6 hits, or Explosive Payload does much the same job is a smaller area.

Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, with there being only one way to the maximum battery size of 7 shots, which is Ionized Battery and a Backup Mag mod (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s). In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. Pair one of those with Bait and Switch for a ×1.3 damage boost for 10s when procced.

As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by 40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune).

Even if you hit 100 recoil, it's still tough to control on controller, so look to boost stability with your barrel and mag perks - a little extra reload speed never hurts too. If you want a primary to use in a boss damage phase, particularly on Hunter, then Slice will sever after a dodge reload, for -40% damage reduction to outgoing boss damage. While you're not going to be using this as your primary damage option, Chaos Reshaped should be procced while stowed for both stacks, so you should get the +35% damage and maybe a burst of healing when you use it with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon.

// Non-Denouement (first-choice PvE)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 111 from 30 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4KO3Yr8AkPRBgKlNmacrGS?si=6dfa9e466dde41a0) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec red-bar adds in end-game content, particularly with an arc build. Shapeable. Non-Dénouement is French for "No final outcome" - make of that what you will! Base stats are good by comparison to its peers, and equate to a 0.622s draw time, 0.42s perfect draw window, 0.43s ADS speed, 0.58s ready and 0.44s stow speed, and 0.78s reload speed. As with most bows, the bowstring and arrow perks will reduce the draw time with Elastic String (reduces to 0.556s), and recover the lost accuracy with Straight Fletching. The roll that everyone's looking for is the "baby" Trinity Ghoul, with Voltshot in the second trait column for jolting and chaining arc damage - which you can improve on with arc aspects and fragments. To pair with this in the first column, Archer's Tempo is reliable as ever, reducing draw time to 0.417s after a crit hit but, if you're after all the explosions, Dragonfly is there too. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers a small boost to draw speed, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod.

The recoil isn't too bad, if you pace your shots but the handling and reload speed could do with some help from the barrel and mag perks.

Shapeable. Summon Bonum is a Latin expression meaning "the supreme good from which all others are derived", and also now an interesting sword too. Stats are pretty much uniform with swords, and this is our first legendary wave frame - much like a a grenade launcher with the heavy attack, with a follow-up targeted attack - hopefully to finish off a weakened enemy. For a boss damage roll, Jagged Edge - with an Backup Mag mod and three reserves mods you'll have 68 ammo, only 2 shy of the maximum of 70 - and Swordmaster's Guard are the usual safe pairing for the blade and guard perks. In trait column one you've got a choice - Relentless Strikes returns one ammo for every third hit but Attrition Orbs might not be the worst call as, with the heavy wave attack you'll get multiple hits counting towards the 10 you need to generate an orb, which you can use to keep weapon surges active, and heal. In the second column Bait and Switch offers a 35% damage bonus when procced, or you could use Whirlwind Blade for up to 30%, Surrounded (depending on the encounter and whether you have adds around or not) for +35% (+41.75% when enhanced). Chaos Reshaped might work, but it'll depend how long you're out of combat (you only have 5s of not dealing or taking damage) before a boss damage phase begins. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers a small boosts to charge rate, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod.

Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - Arrowhead Brake boosts recoil direction to 100, and adds 10 to Handling. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots. You can double this with Reconstruction in the first trait column and then, for a backup boss damage weapon in the second column, Chaos Reshaped is likely to have built up two stacks in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost, or Firing Line provides an easy +20% to damage just for standing near your fireteam. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

The Riposte is the Final Shape expansion's Competitive playlist reward - a unique Lightweight frame AR which grants the usual +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed with the fire rate of a rapid-fire. Base stats equate to 24.00m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.30s ADS speed, 0.38s ready and 0.35s stow speed, and 1.79s reload speed, which compares well with the raid rapid-fire AR Rufus's Fury. Recoil is not great on controller, but stability barrel and mag perks can help, and you also get a choice of stocks that can assist too - Fitted Stock adds 20 Recoil Directions and 10 Stability for a small Handling loss. Aim to get to around 80 Stability, and you should be fine. If control isn't so much of an issue for you, then Short Action Stock or Composite Stock will boost Handling for a snappier gunfeel. For add-clearing, the void trait perk pairing of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds work really well together, and synergise with builds using void aspects and fragments.

Aisha's Care is the first heavy burst frame pulse rifle that sits in the kinetic slot, as a Strand weapon, but unfortunately the trait perks are mainly PvP focussed, with it being a Trials weapon. Base stats are excellent compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 37.40m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.05s reload speed. Saying that, handling and reload speed could definitely do with some help from the barrel and magazine perk slots. Slice is always useful in the first trait perk column when facing a boss, to apply Sever and reduce damage output by -40% - particularly running a Hunter. You can go all-in to Strand with Hatchling, and benefit from Strand aspect and fragment synergy for both perks - you should be getting plenty of easy crit kills to generate Threadlings, or boost damage output through Collective Action or Golden Tricorn. You have a choice of three useful origin trait, so just go with whatever suits your playstyle or current activity. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

At the ranges you'll be engaging enemies, Keep Away in the first trait perk column will improve accuracy, as well as improving reload time to 1.58s. That makes it ideal to pair with Desperado, which provides an effective +33% increase in damage output.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 110 from 23 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6VJFjsCdq5QckUaK2qXQn7?si=9032e578e9874dda) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing minor enemies in end-game actives, particularly when using Strand fragments. Aisha's Care (Adept) is the first heavy burst frame pulse rifle that sits in the kinetic slot, as a Strand weapon, but unfortunately the trait perks are mainly PvP focussed, with it being a Trials weapon. Base stats are excellent compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 37.40m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.05s reload speed. Saying that, handling and reload speed could definitely do with some help from the barrel and magazine perk slots. Slice is always useful in the first trait perk column when facing a boss, to apply Sever and reduce damage output by -40% - particularly running a Hunter, and with access to Strand aspects and fragments. You can go all-in to Strand with Hatchling - you should be getting plenty of easy crit kills to generate Threadlings, or boost damage output through Collective Action or Golden Tricorn. You have a choice of three useful origin trait, so just go with whatever suits your playstyle or current activity. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

Saying that, handling and reload speed could definitely do with some help from the barrel and magazine perk slots. At the ranges you'll be engaging enemies, Keep Away in the first trait perk column will improve accuracy, as well as improving reload time to 1.58s.

Shapeable. Corrasion - the process of mechanical erosion by abrasion - is the arc member of the new meta pulse rifle - it looks good, and is easily available during Final Shape. Base stats are, as you'd expect, poor compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 36.76m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.12s reload speed. It fires slowly enough for recoil not to be too much of an issue, so you can focus on Handling and Reload Speed with the barrel and mag perks. Unusually, there's a damage perk in the first trait column - High-Impact Reserves, so you can double up damage multipliers in the second column with Frenzy for +15% and maxxed handling and reload speed. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the pulse rifle's decent damage multiplier and any damage bonus, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

Shapeable. Aberrant Action is the third rocket-frame sidearm - solar flavour this time, with similar stats to Indebted Kindness (if the Range reads 0, then that's just a bug). In the barrel and mag, you can prefer perks that give extra Blast Radius, Velocity or an extra shot or two (or a bit of a mix) - that's really down to personal preference. Match the lethality of the rocket sidearms with Heal Clip and Incandescent, particularly when synergising with solar aspects and fragments to boost the verb potency, and you'll be curing yourself x2 and nearby teammates x1 while wiping out add crowds with scorch and ignition. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing minor enemies in general actives, particularly with arc fragments. Shapeable. Corrasion - the process of mechanical erosion by abrasion - is the arc member of the new meta pulse rifle - it looks good, and is easily available during Final Shape. Base stats are, as you'd expect, poor compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 36.76m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.12s reload speed. It fires slowly enough for recoil not to be too much of an issue, so you can focus on Handling and Reload Speed with the barrel and mag perks. If you're looking for a Voltshot roll, then you'll need a reload perk in the first trait column - Perpetual Motion provides a passive boost or - and don't judge me too harshly for this - Air Trigger provides Outlaw-like reload speeds just for being in the air as you reload. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the pulse rifle's decent damage multiplier, so the initial explosion is as damaging as a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

The damage output from this subfamily is good, but unfortunately the stats are poor. They are helped by the Omolon Fluid Dynamics origin trait in the top half of the magazine though, and you can flesh them out a little more with the barrel and mag perks. In the first trait perk column, Rapid Hit, Enlightened Action or Perpetual Motion are good ways of boosting the stats still further and, if you don't have easy access to the volatility verb, Destabilizing Rounds in the second column will help clear add crowds quickly and synergise with void-themed fragments. You should end up with a gun that starts out feeling good in a gunfight, and ends up feeling very good for add clearing. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

First, the Wild Card origin trait works well on a shotgun, as the little energy bolts inherit its high combatant weapon scaling. The weapon itself has quite poor stats but it boasts some great, and unique, possible trait perk pairings. You can go with any barrel perk of your preference, other than Smoothbore or Rifled Barrel. Assault Mag and then Tactical Mag are the best of the magazine perks. As a slightly off-piste choice, the trait perk pairing of Discord and Chain Reaction - which is excellent on shotguns as the explosion damage also inherits the damage scaling - or Surrounded for +47% damage when enhanced, will allow you to get a kill with your other weapon, and then go on a tear for 7s refunding every killing shot fired. For a double special loadout, this is really useful for ammo economy. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

"Ded Gramarye" translates as "dead" and "occult learning, magic, or enchantment" from archaic English so, necromancy, at a guess. First, the Wild Card origin trait works well on a shotgun, as the little energy bolts inherit its high combatant weapon scaling. The weapon itself has quite poor stats but it boasts some great, and unique, possible trait perk pairings. You can go with any barrel perk of your preference, other than Smoothbore or Rifled Barrel. Assault Mag and then Tactical Mag are the best of the magazine perks. If you're running Tractor Cannon and double shotgun, this could find a way into your loadout with the trait pairing of Slickdraw for fast ready and stow and Vorpal Weapon for its easy +15% damage against Majors and Bosses. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Suspectum-4fr (First-choice PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), Ionized Battery, Envious Assassin, (Firing Line, Precision Instrument)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 108 from 9 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/20WqdTYGB2K4SfWYePZWo1?si=0c706567ddea4e10) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained boss damage. "Suspectum" is a Latin adjective meaning "mistrusted" and - fun fact - is also the specific name for the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). In Destiny 2, this is a precision frame (so you can ignore recoil stats) stasis fusion rifle. The Veist Stinger origin trait, even post-nerf - is still handy for a partial reload and and gunfeel boosts. Try to improve handling a little with the barrel perk, and then in the battery perk slot, Ionized Battery plus Backup Mag is the only way to get to the maximum of 7 shots. That means, with three reserves mods and a fully procced Envious Assassin in the first trait column you'll have 21 shots of your 23 total in your battery (and if Veist Singer procs, you'll run out before reloading). You can't get Bait and Switch, but Firing Line's +20% damage in a fireteam is perfectly respectable and doesn't need reproccing, or Precision Instrument tops out at +25% per shot once you hit six crits in a row. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

"Suspectum" is a Latin adjective meaning "mistrusted" and - fun fact - is also the specific name for the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). In Destiny 2, this is a precision frame (so you can ignore recoil stats) stasis fusion rifle. The Veist Stinger origin trait, even post-nerf - is still handy for a partial reload and andy gunfeel boosts. Try to improve handling a little with the barrel perk, and then in the battery perk slot, as you're looking for speed rather than raw damage, Accelerated Coils gets your shot off a little faster. Envious Assassin in the first trait perk column can overflow the battery to 18 shots, 15 of which will proc Chill Clip in the second column, so you'll be able to disrupt Overloads with a single shot or stun Unstoppables with two at a safe distance. Recommended MW: Charge Time or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

Try to improve handling a little with the barrel perk, and then in the battery perk slot, as you're looking for speed rather than raw damage, Accelerated Coils gets your shot off a little faster. Although not entirely serious, Suspectum is one of only two LFRs that can roll with both stasis synergy trait perks - Headstone in the first column and Chill Clip in the second. You'll still be able to disrupt Overloads with a single shot or stun Unstoppables with two at a safe distance, and to generate stasis crystals on a crit kill, to use with stasis fragments.

// Bold Endings
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The first in a nice long list of new weapons is Bold Endings. A newish archetype being the heavy burst archetype, only occupied by Warden's Law. Bold Endings has the unique combination of Headstone and Dragonfly to immediately blow up those crystals. Great for add clear. Other solid options include Rapid Hit for reload speed and a tighter burst at max stacks, Strategist for immediate stability on class ability usage, and getting your class ability faster. Alongside Desperate Measures for great damage. Headstone with a damage perk or more AoE is probably going to be the play." Recommended MW: Stability or Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Unfortunately the Corrasion has no good reload perk outside of Perpetual Motion. The other stats are nice but I'm not always in motion to take advantage of it. High-Impact Reserves in the third column is interesting to beef up some damage at the end of your magazine but it doesn't do anything to aid us in getting to the next one. Frenzy does bump up handling and reload if you opt for that and will bump up your damage on top of High-Impact Reserves.

// Origin Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Origin Story was probably most Vanilla vets first legendary weapon. Autos being as strong as they were in year 1 plus you got a great and consistent one right out the gate. Feeding Frenzy and Target Lock or Kinetic Tremors or even Onslaught will be amazing in all activities with Keep Away being a more passive bonus to reload and accuracy."

// Hush
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Hush is back! Arguably the greatest bow to ever exist. Archer’s Gambit also makes a return this season You can pair that with Archer’s Tempo for even faster draw times bringing it all the way down to a 157ms draw time with Elastic String and a draw time masterwork. Unrelenting with Incandescent will allow you to keep your health up while downing groups from afar and Shoot to Loot with either Incandescent or Explosive Head is niche but can keep your ammo topped up."

// The Riposte
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Our second only lightweight auto rifle behind a blue rare version. The Riposte is a great showing for a hybrid SMG and auto. 720 auto rifles have always been sorta niche being able to have the TtK of and SMG while maintaining the falloff and range of some auto rifles. Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds are both great options for Void builds. Enlightened Action brings up your already decent handling and reload speed just for shooting and hitting targets. Desperate Measures being able to boost your damage up whether you’re on Void or any subclass." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Shadow Price returns to us, is it better than before? Depends on what you’re looking to do. Overflow is the best option in column 3 but has no synergy with the best perk in column 4. Voltshot requires reloads to work and Overflow bypasses and does not allow you to reload when the magazine is larger than normal.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Shadow Price returns to us, is it better than before? Depends on what you’re looking to do. Overflow is the best option in column 3 but has no synergy with the best perk in column 4. Voltshot requires reloads to work and Overflow bypasses and does not allow you to reload when the magazine is larger than normal.

// Imminence
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Imminence with Chaos Reshaped or Firefly will be a weapon to bring to any activity.

// Non-Denouement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "No arguments here, this is the best weapon from the Salvation’s Edge raid. Non-Denouement, while hard to spell, gives us something we haven’t seen before; Dragonfly and Voltshot together. Dragonfly allows you to get some AoE damage on the initial kill while Voltshot on a bow will make it so as long as you’re getting kills you’ll be able to jolt on the next shot. Dealing AoE damage on top of more AoE damage and jolt is just hilariously fun and gives Trinity Ghoul vibes without the cost of your exotic. You cannot hold onto the Voltshot shot like Trinity Ghoul but that alone separates this legendary from the exotic." Recommended MW: Accuracy, or Draw Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// (Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Alloy Mag, Fluted Barrel), (Demolitionist, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Threat Detector, Feeding Frenzy, Keep Away), Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 109 from 17 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nTeQvaqobDnHpu43iq8eH?si=091612d7b0604589) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for Minor add clearing in general content. Wanna fire the same Precision AR as Zavala? Origin Story returns with a refreshed (if huge) perk pool. If you're focussing make sure you've reset your reputation a few times first. The precision frame makes recoil easier to handle but the stats are on the low side, so you can use the barrel and magazine perks to fill them out a little. You've got a choice of first column support perks to add utility, boost gunfeel stats or directly improve reload speed. In the second column, Onslaught can dramatically improve outgoing damage as you're killing adds. Either Origin Trait can work, depending on whether you want a little bit of health or slightly improved gunfeel. The perk pool is huge, so reset Vanguard rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: any - dealer's choice, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 109 from 17 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nTeQvaqobDnHpu43iq8eH?si=091612d7b0604589) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for damage against Major and Boss enemies. Scintillation (that is, the process of being sparkly) is the first Strand adaptive burst LFR. It's got decent stats and feels good to use, and the Veist Stinger, while not the powerhouse it once more, is still the best origin trait to have on an LFR. With this being a three shot burst, you'll imp[rove control with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk. The best battery perk is Enhanced Battery which, with a Backup Mag mod, is your first step towards the maximum 7 shots but, if you get Accelerated Coils that also works to improve DPS rate at the cost of a small drop to total damage. In the first trait column, Envious Assassin can triple your number of shots to 21 - pretty much all of your reserve ammo. In the second, Reservoir Burst is the final step to get to 7 shots in the base battery, adds +25% damage to every overflowed shot and, if you kill your target, the explosion is 4x stronger than Chain Reaction would be. Recommended MW: Handling or Charge Time, with a Backup Mag mod.

Use the barrel and mag perks to round out gunfeel stats. For end-game use, looking at first column trait perks that don't need a kill to proc and which further fill out the gunfeel stats Rapid Hit, Enlightened Action, Perpetual Motion all work. Air Trigger might be more of a PvP perk, but provides Outlaw-like reload speeds if you're off the ground. In the second column, One For All provides a +30% damage bonus for hitting three enemies, or Explosive Payload adds a little extra damage and flinch. The perk pool is huge, so reset Crucible rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Warden's Law (PvE)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag), (Fourth Time's The Charm, Enlightened Action, Perpetual Motion), Vorpal Waepon
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use in end-game content. The re-reprised Warden's Law was the first of the heavy burst subfamily, and provides good, if slightly clunky-feeling damage. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both also do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. Using Tactical Mag or Appended Mag as the magazine perk, with a Backup Mag mod, will bring the magazine to its maximum of 14. The two shot burst makes this useful for disrupting overloads - you can look for a first column trait perk that helps with gunfeel or ammo economy, to pair with Vorpal Weapon in the second for a little extra damage against majors and bosses. TYhe Stunning Recovery origin trait pairs well for this anti_champion role. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in end-game content, for Titans using Hazardous Propulsion. The reprised Shadow Price comes back into a very competitive arc auto rifle ecosystem and, while it's not a bad option, with good stats, it doesn't really offer anything new either so only look at this if you don't have similar arc AR options already. Being a precision frame, you can ignore recoil direction, so just use the barrel and mag perks to improve the gunfeel further and boost reload speed. For Titans who need their barricade back as fast as possible to use Hazardous Propulsion with, Strategist speeds up class ability regeneration in the first trait perk column, and you can pair this with either One For All for a damage boost of +35%, or Surrounded if you're playing in CQC ranges and gain a +40% (+47% when enhanced) damage boost. The Vanguard's Vindication origin trait is useful, if not very noticeable. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in end-game content, for Titans using Hazardous Propulsion. The reprised Shadow Price comes back into a very competitive arc auto rifle ecosystem and, while it's not a bad option, with good stats, it doesn't really offer anything new either so only look at this if you don't have similar arc AR options already. Being a precision frame, you can ignore recoil direction, so just use the barrel and mag perks to improve the gunfeel further and boost reload speed. For Titans who need their barricade back as fast as possible to use Hazardous Propulsion with, Strategist speeds up class ability regeneration in the first trait perk column, and you can pair this with either One For All for a damage boost of +35%, or Surrounded if you're playing in CQC ranges and gain a +40% (+47% when enhanced) damage boost. The Vanguard's Vindication origin trait is useful, if not very noticeable. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in end-game content. Hush is back, but is now in a quite crowded pool of solar bows, so it doesn't really stand out. If you already have a well-rolled solar bow, you can happily pass. If you're still looking, bring down Draw Time as much as you can with your Bowstring perk, and then recover any lost accuracy with the Arrow perk. The standard endgame bow pairings of either Archer's Tempo or Shoot to Loot in the first perk column are available in the first trait perk column, with Explosive Head in the second for a little bonus damage and flinch, or Frenzy for a reliable +15% damage, and mexxed reload speed and handling. The perk pool is huge, so reset Gambit rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. The Gun and Run origin trait is useful, if not very noticeable. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Slice, Hatchling
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in general content, particularly with strand fragments. The reprised The Guiding Sight has a couple of extra tricks up its sleeve that might be worth looking for. The stats are pretty much in-band, although there aren't many peers to compare against, but you'll definitely appreciate some extra handling and reload speed, so focus on improving those with the barrel and magazine perks. For strand fragment synergy you now have access to both Slice (probably easier to proc for Hunters, with the faster cooldown for Dodge) and Hatchling in the two trait perk columns. The Nadir Focus origin trait is useful to help land repeated crits, so that's the one to choose. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Claws of the Wolf (PvE)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds), Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in general content, particularly with void fragments. Claws of the Wolf returns in season 24 with a largely new (largely PvP-focussed) perk pool, but with stats the look a bit anaemic by comparison with its peers. The Recoil Direction needs a bit of attention, so Arrowhead Brake is the obvious barrel perk to sort that out. In the magazine perk slot, you could either look to fill out the stats a little more, or get a combat effect mag perk. If you don't already have an Elsie's Rifle with the void combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds in the two trait perk columns, then this roll can synergise with void fragments to boost the subclass verbs and provide a void overshield while clearing groups of adds. Unfortunately, the Skulking Wolf origin trait has no effect outside of Iron Banner. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 106 from 3 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jGtQ3pw94PV7XpXREQ094?si=ddb5fb64813048e1) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. Veiled Threat looks lovely (like Vex Mytholast had a baby!) but unfortunately drops with poor base stats compared to its peers, so if you have a Krait you're happy with you can probably pass on by. If you're shooting adds at the outer reach of its range (22.6m at base), you might appreciate a little extra stability on controller, otherwise maybe a bit of extra range or stability with the barrel perk. In the mag slot, Alloy Mag can double down on the intrinsic frame perk to reduce reload time from 1.83s to 1.24s when empty, or Tactical Mag (1.68s) or Flared Magwell (1.61s) work at any point in the magazine if you can't wait. There's an interesting interaction between Shoot to Loot in the first trait perk column and the Radiolaria Transposer origin trait when procced - any ammo caught in the pool will be picked up. In the second, to boost damage, Desperate Measures adds up to +30% or Collective Action adds a flat +20%, and both are easy to proc with Transcendence. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: any - your preference, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Lost Signal (First-choice PvE)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), High-Velocity Rounds, (Auto-Loading Holster, Stats for All), One for All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 106 from 3 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jGtQ3pw94PV7XpXREQ094?si=ddb5fb64813048e1) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. Lost Signal is the first of a new special grenade launcher "area denial" subfamily which, from this example, has promise. You can think of this as a baby Witherhoard or a stasis flamethrower, firing five projectiles per shot that form flame pools where they hit something (even in the air). Use the barrel perk to boost handling and velocity - Quick Launch is best with Smart Drift Control as a second choice, and High-Velocity Rounds is the best of the two magazine perks. In the first trait column, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses the need to worry about reload speed, or Stats for All can boost Handling and Reload Stats to 100. In the second, as the raw AoE damage isn't huge, One for All can easily boost damage by a hefty +35% and all the damage ticks are great for recovering darkness Transcendence energy. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling mod.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 106 from 3 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jGtQ3pw94PV7XpXREQ094?si=ddb5fb64813048e1) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing in end-game content, particularly when using arc fragments. Shapeable. Sightline Survey is essentially how non-Raiding Guardians can craft an arc hand cannon. But, if you already have a Posterity, you can move along! The stats are towards the bottom of comparators although on the plus side, with the frame intrinsic, at least you don't have to worry about recoil direction. Handling could definitely do with a boost from the barrel perk - Fluted Barrel is best, with maybe Corkscrew Rifling instead if that's all the drops. you can boost Reload Speed, which is a poor 2.54s at base, with the magazine perk - Flared Magwell (2.29s), or Tactical Mag (2.37s). In the first trait perk column, Enlightened Action. You get three stacks per hit, so four hits will grant +50 Handling and Reload Speed for 2s, reducing reload time to 1.83s, or Triple Tap will extend your magazine size. Finally, in the second trait slot, Desperate Measures can bost damage by up to +30%, and is easy to proc with Transcendence. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), Swordmaster's Guard, (Unrelenting, Relentless Strikes, Tireless Blade)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 106 from 3 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jGtQ3pw94PV7XpXREQ094?si=ddb5fb64813048e1) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for stunning Overload Champions. Shapeable. Ill Omen is the first Stasis Caster from sword that can drop Cold Steel - which is potentially exciting for being able to disrupt Overload champions from a distance... except at the point of reviewing this weapon, in practice it's very inconsistent. To keep or craft one in the hope this bug gets fixed, you'll want to maximise ammo rather than damage with the Blade perk. For the guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit to everything and then, although there's not much that pairs with Cold Steel projectile attacks in the first trait perk column, Unrelenting, Relentless Strikes or Tireless Blade might be occasionally useful. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Ill Omen (PvE)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies. Shapeable. Ill Omen is the first Stasis Caster from sword so potentially provides both CQC and occasional distance damage with a sword. For add-clearing, you'll want to maximise ammo rather than damage with the Blade perk. For the guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit to everything and then for boss damage, Relentless Strikes aand  Whirlwind Blade is the best trait perk pairing for sustained boss damage (although this isn't necessarily the frame I'd choose to do boss damage with..!). The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like?  Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits (there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up) which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. The first and second trait column perks can double down on the frame intrinsic perks through Physic which grants x1 Restoration (x2 when enhanced) for 5s to both you and allies when procced, and Circle of Life which boosts damage on healing by an additional +25% for 10s (+37.5% total for the first 5s with the Support Frame Boost) for both you and the healed Guardian. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have (who doesn't love more super energy?) - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. There aren't many comparators for Bold Endings - the good news is that the base stats are great, but the bad news is that they're still not very good, with stability, handling and reload speed all low so, although it's hard-hitting, it feels a bit clunky. Use the barrel and magazine perks to fill in the gaps. To help further, you can quickly get to the maximum stacks of Rapid Hit as the first trait perk, and you have ways of getting to three stacks of Desperate Measures using Transcendent melee and grenade for up to +30% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against major and bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you already have a good backup DPS sniper then you can safely pass on Embraced Identity. Decent base stats so, as ever, handling is the stat to boost with the barrel perk. Tactical Mag plus a Backup Mag mod gets you to 6 shots, or Appended Mag + Backup Mag gets you to 7. In the first trait column, Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction are both excellent. In the second column, Precision Instrument or High Ground both boost damage via different proc mechanisms, depending on whether you have a big crit spot to aim for, or can get your feet at least one metre higher than the feet of what you're shooting at (so, weirdly, you can have it procced and still be shooting up at a taller enemy's head).

// The Call (First-choice PvE)
// (Quick Launch, Volatile Launch, Linear Compensator), (Tactical Mag, High-Velocity Rounds, High-Explosive Ordnance), (Subsistence, Lead from Gold), One for All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Minor and Major add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. The Call is the best weapon to come from the Pale Heart weapon set. There's only one other rocket-assisted frame, so there's not much to compare against, but the stats don't honestly matter. You'd normally look for velocity in a non-hitscan weapon, but there's an argument to be made for blast radius too so the barrel and mag perk choices depend on your preference (although be aware that High-Explosive Ordnance will reduce the base mag size to 9). This is going to one-hit kill red bars in most content, so Subsistence is a good choice to bypass reloading entirely, or Lead from Gold will help with the already good ammo economy in the first trait perk column. In the second, One for All can proc from AoE damage ticks - which is why you might want to focus on blast radius - for +35% bonus damage for 10s. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have (who doesn't love more super energy?) - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for burst DPS against Majors and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. Someday has in-band stats and is the only kinetic precision frame shotgun currently available.

As the support perk in the first trait column, Threat Detector and Lead for Gold are viable options, or the new Threat Remover looks interesting. Then in the second column, this is the only non-Raid shotgun, and the first pellet shotgun, that can roll with Recombination, which adds up to +100% damage to the next shot, ideal for tanky enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for backup DPS against Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you don't already have a fusion rifle for backup DPS, Axial Lacuna is available and shapeable. If you're interested, a lacuna is a gap or blank space, so the name refers to something missing in the direction of an axis. Improve your handling with your barrel perk, and then with your battery, Accelerated Coils is probably the top choice, but there's also something to be said for the extra shots you'll get from Enhanced Battery. there's nothing better than Reconstruction in the first trait perk slot, doubling your battery's capacity for a damage phase. In the second trait slot, Controlled Burst is the go-to trait for bonus damage, both adding +20% damage and reducing charge time for just landing all your bolts.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained DPS against Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. Pro Memoria - which means "for memory" in Latin, and is also the name for a formal note embodying the written record of a diplomatic discussion - is the first in a new aggressive frame LMG subtype. It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the barrel perk to provide help with control and a little extra handling. As the magazine perk, for sustained boss damage, you'll want a perk that increases mag size or possibly helps a little more with recoil control. For sustained damage, in the first trait perk column, choose between Reconstruction for an effortless overflowed mag or Envious Assassin for a potentially bigger overflowed mag that needs add kills. In the second column, Target Lock or Bait and Switch (although the swap speed isn't great) make the most of your bullets in a sustained boss DPS phase.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. Pro Memoria - which means "for memory" in Latin, and is also the name for a formal note embodying the written record of a diplomatic discussion - is the first in a new aggressive frame LMG subtype. It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the 	 to provide help with control and a little extra handling. As the magazine perk, Ricichet Rounds helps a little more with recoil control, or you can use High-Caliber or Armor-Piercing Rounds for additional combat effects. As a "heavy scout rifle" for add clearing, it never hurts to have a bigger mag, so you can use Reconstruction or Envious Assassin in the first trait slot, and then Desperate Measures is easy to proc with Transcendent for up to +30% damage, you should be creating plenty of strand tangles to proc Collective Action's +20% damage, or Frenzy is a reliable +15% plus maxxed handling and reload speed. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have (who doesn't love more super energy?) - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. False Idols is the latest vortex frame sword, and as all swords have pretty much the same stats, this is definitely in-band. Like all vortex frames, it's not currently good for boss damage with the cost/benefit of the spin-to-win heavy attack but if you want to save one for a possible future buff, start with a blade perk that boosts damage. In the guard perk slot, Swordmaster's Guard just buffs a little bit of everything. Then, in the first trait perk slot, Relentless Strikes passively returns ammo on hits while, in the second, Bait and Switch adds +30% damage when procced, or in the right circumstances, Surrounded adds +35% damage (+41.75% when enhanced).

It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors (which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors), One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

Hammerhead has lots of competition in the void Adaptive-frame LMG subfamily.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk.

This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. The BRAVE Hung Jury offers Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column, which you can pair with another damage perk in the second - Explosive Payload just works all the time, or One For All is +35% damage when procced. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clearing in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, Explosive Payload is, again, probably best or Precision Instrument can be okay if you're hitting your headshots. Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw) with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clearing in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, you should be able to create Stasis crystals easily enough, to synergise with the subclass fragments, but they'll be a long way away! Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Summoner returns with great stats and an interesting PvE perk pool. The recoil could do with a little taming, so you can use barrel and mag perks to help, or go with the combat effect magansine of your choice. For the trait perks, Perpetual Motion is just a useful all-around boost to gunfeel to pair with a second column damage perk like Onslaught (the extra stability is hand to control the recoil at three stacks), Golden Tricorn or Target Lock. Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead but honestly, Wild Card is much more fun.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with Hunters on Strand subclasses.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Mountaintop
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "We can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Edge Transit
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh how the meme’s be meme’ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

Kinetic Tremors also moved to column 3 allowing you to stack two damage perks! Rewind Rounds might be better if you're using Hung Jury as your primary and taking down wave after wave of enemies, pair that with Firefly for AoE damage and you will seldom reload.

// Falling Guillotine
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Elsie's Rifle
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Elsie's Rifle is a throwback to D1, and another good weapon Bungie could have brought back was Murmur, the element switching fusion *from the Moon.* Jokes aside, Elsie's Rifle is incredible. Rewind Rounds or Feeding Frenzy paired with Desperate Measures or Desperado, any combination of the above will be more than lethal. Arrowhead Brake is a must have regardless of what activity you bring this rifle into, I don't know if there's a small bug within the timelines of this rifle but having Arrowhead Brake fixes a large majority of issues."

// Forbearance (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Mountaintop (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "We can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Edge Transit (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh how the meme’s be meme’ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Falling Guillotine (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Hammerhead (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well. Desperate Measures is the best of both worlds combining Adrenaline Junkie / Swashbuckler and Golden Tricorn." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Elsie's Rifle is a throwback to D1, and another good weapon Bungie could have brought back was Murmur, the element switching fusion *from the Moon.* Jokes aside, Elsie's Rifle is incredible. Rewind Rounds or Feeding Frenzy paired with Desperate Measures or Desperado, any combination of the above will be more than lethal. Arrowhead Brake is a must have regardless of what activity you bring this rifle into, I don't know if there's a small bug within the timelines of this rifle but having Arrowhead Brake fixes a large majority of issues."

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Darkest Before is now changed up and swapped to solar. With this change it synergizes better with solar subclass verbs. Heal Clip and Incandescent are fantastic together and allow you to push out your engagement ranges a bit further because it’s a pulse rifle. The issue I have with this is that Darkest Before is a rapid-fire frame, meaning it does really low damage per shot. Sometimes needing two or even three bursts for a red bar.

// Judgment
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Judgment got an upgrade going from Kinetic to Stasis. While now it competes with the very dominant and popular Eyasluna, both being from a dungeon makes the competition also even. Headstone also being in the third column gives Judgment a huge edge. Being able to rock a damage perk and Headstone elevate Judgement past Eyasluna, however, Eyasluna is also able to get Unrelenting for better health. To each their own, but that is what makes Destiny so great." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

Trench Barrel and Grave Robber are great combinations for “maining” this shotgun but an even better combination would be Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace, the issue with this combo is that it’s a shotgun and not a primary ammo weapon."

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Adjudicator has decent stats and, with a precision frame, you don't need to worry too much about the published Recoil Direction. A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload, for you to keep uptime for Onslaught, in the second trait column, to boost RPM for additional damage to mow down adds. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

// Relentless (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Armor Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Flared Magwell), Slice, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Relentless returns as a Strand pulse rifle with below average stats that reveal its Season 1 origin. The recoil direction of 65 is vertical, if a little loose, so you either look to improve it further or, if you can handle the recoil, push out the range with your barrel perk. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You don't need to run a strand subclass but if you do then Slice and Hatchling can sever enemies to reduce their damage output (very useful in a boss fight to help your fireteam), and generate Threadlings for additional damage to synergise with your fragments. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You can find the Heal Clip/ Incandescent trait perk combination on other pulse rifles but it is very nice to help keep your fireteam's health topped up, while you're incinerating crowds of minor spec adds while synergising with your solar subcalss fragments.

If you are making do, then Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling pad out the Handling stats a little as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag speeds up shots, or Tactical Mag adds one to the mag as the magazine perk. You could take your choice of either Threat Detector's Handling and Reload buffs or Envious Assassin for an overflowed magazine to start an engagement with.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with arc subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick - you'll likely need to run some ammo reserve mods. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities.

// (Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Rewind Rounds, Subsistence), Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds. Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Range, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

// Crux Termination IV (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hard Launch, Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Impact Casing, (Envious Assassin, Reconstruction, Clown Cartridge), Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Uzume RR4 has very nice stats in it's subfamily, but the 50 zoom is either a blessing or a curse, depending on your viewpoint. Either way this is only worth keeping if you don't have a decent solar sniper, or it's better than the one you're replacing. The recoil direction of 75 is vertical, but if you're firing repeatedly at a crit spot it's still a good idea to control it with a boost to recoil direction or additional stability from your barrel perk. Handling is always nice to have too. Appended Mag gets you an extra shot - you can also use Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell to boost reload speed as your mag perk instead. In the first trait column as the support park, Fourth Time's The Charm or Clown Cartridge are pretty much tied - if you can reliably hit crits, FttC might get you an extra shot more reliably before reloading. In the second as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon is the best of the bunch for a permanently-on +15% against Major Spec and Boss Spec enemies.

For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies in end-game content. Unfortunately, Retrofuturist is distinctly meh, so it's only worth hanging onto a roll if it fills a hole in your vault, and even then you'll have to reset your Crucible rank a few times to stand a decent chance of the roll you're after. As a Lightweight shotgun, you do get the +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed and, for some reason, it has a base mags size of 7, but that's where the praise ends. If you're hanging onto one, try a barrel perk that adds Handling, although a bit of range and stability doesn't hurt either. Assault Mag and Tactical Mag are the best mag perk choices, but Appended Mag or Light Mag aren't bad. For burst damage against majors, the trait combination of Auto-Loading Holster and Trench Barrel is decent enough.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Belisarius-D (Belisarius isn't a dinosaur, but rather a 5th Century Byzantine general) has strong stats but, like all Aggressive Burst pulse rifles, suffers poor handling and reload speed. Arrowhead Brake adds handling and corrects the recoil direction to 100 or Fluted Barrel gives the highest handling bump as the barrel perk. Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. The traits are mostly PvP flavoured but Slice and Hatchling in the first and second trait columns work together as a weapon to synergise with Strand subclass fragments - this could make it a good option as part of a Bait and Switch rotation with Slice reducing outgong damage from a major boss by 40% when procced - or alternatively, Rapid Hit and Keep Away, again in the first column bump up gunfeel stats. Short Action Stock is the stock of choice, for another +15 to handling. Recommended MW: Handling, with a damage boosting (Boss Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. Enhanced Battery increases the magazine without a reload penalty and, while Demolitionist on a trace rifle only returns the same grenade energy as a primary weapon, you should be getting enough kills to make the payoff worth it. Headstone generates Stasis crystals on crit kills, so lets you build into Stasis verbs and fragments - Whisper of Shards will further improve grenade recharge rates. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Scatter Signal (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), Enhanced Battery, Overflow, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS, but you might want to keep one just in case, if you don't have a slug shotty already. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. If you're looking for a backup DPS weapon, then a reloading perk in the first trait column - Fourth Time's The Charm, Reconstruction, Threat Detector, or Lead From Gold for you ammo economy are all possible. For a damage boosting perk in the second trait slot, choose between Surrounded, if you're likely to be in CQC with extra adds, or Vorpal Weapon for a reliable 15% boost to damage against Majors and Bosses. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

// Scalar Potential (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Enlightened Action, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for bulkier Minor spec add clearing in general content, particularly with an arc subclass. Shapeable. Scalar Potential has decent stats and a nice clean scope, but you're limited by a PvP trait perk pool. Arrowhead Brake is probably the best barrel perk, although you could imrpve handling or range if you can handle the recoil direction. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are then the pick of the mag perks. As the support perk in the first trait column, Enlightened Action boosts both handling and reload speed by 50 after five hits. In the second column as the signature perk, your arc abilities should make the second stack of Golden Tricorn easy to proc for +50% damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Doomed Petitioner (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake), Ionized Battery, Envious Assassin, (Precision Instrument, Surrounded)

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Tigerspite (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Full Bore, Extended Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds), Subsistence, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit.

// Abide the Return (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard), Relentless Strikes, Whirlwind Blade
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases damage and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC with a boss. The usual trait combination of Relentless Strikes, returning one ammo for everyth three light hits, and Whirlwind Blade for an escalating +3% bump to damage topping off at +30% for landing light hits makes for a decent, if not top-tier option for boss DPS phases. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +20 charge rate for faster heavy attacks, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting (Boss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

// Twilight Oath
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Similarly to Retold Tale, Twilight Oath has PvE perks but not the best position. Envious Assassin is great for overfilling the magazine, and Vorpal Weapon will net you great damage. You can utilize the full extent of Precision Instrument, my biggest issue is the frame. Rapid-fire frame snipers are hard to utilize at max RPM and require a hard pull down to keep on target. With the crit box shrinking on some bosses and champions doing what champions want to do, it will be hard to continuously hit crits at max RPM. Otherwise it’s a pretty solid general use sniper."

Being able to walk over bricks of special to double the magazine capacity keeps Killing Tally primed and ready to rip into any wave of enemy you might have in front of you.

// Imperative
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Most of us already have. Workhorse PvE scout. If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively. I’d still recommend Rapid Hit over both as missing a shot is extremely unforgiving with the slower rate of fire. Precision hits are going to be the goal, why not make follow up shot easier while we’re at it." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

But for a “Kinetic” fusion rifle I think Scatter Signal rivals and possibly beats out Riptide for best in slot fusion. Overflow and Controlled Burst for added damage throughout the magazine. You’ll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase.

// Lethophobia
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lethophobia is defined as an abnormal anxiety of forgetting. Let’s hope you don’t forget the god rolls of this bow then. As with most PvE bows you’re looking for a good combination of draw time and accuracy. Successful Warm-Up gives you a better draw time post-defeat, but has a bit less utility against higher health enemies. Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass. You can run a full void or full strand or stasis loadout without much thought. Just remember that the damage change goes away when you stow this weapon."

Arrowhead isn’t necessary with our deterministic recoil, but I found the bursts a bit tighter and easier to control.

// Chivalric Fire
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller / M+KB): "Our full ritual playlist weapon is an interesting one. Caster frame swords have not been strong since their introduction. So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you’ll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we’re back to square one. Chivalric Fire is a great neutral sword that works best on Void subclasses, but you can utilize either orb generation or volatility to great success without committing to Void."

It’s less useful without Match Game but it can still be useful for taking out shields faster. Archer’s Tempo is fantastic on bows for lowering successive draw times, and Precision Instrument fits nicely as you’ll want to hit those crits, the draw time allowing you a bit of forgiveness lining up those crit shots. You could even switch it up and go with Explosive Payload and Successful Warm-Up if you’re using this in lower and PvE where you can one shot everything to keep Successful Warm-Up going."

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this. As the first trait column support perk, Perpetual Motion adds further stat bonuses just for moving, or Unrelenting's bonus health is useful in CQC, while in the second column as the signature perk, Frenzy boosts the handling and reload speed up to 100 and adds 15% bonus damage when procced. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for chunkier add-clearing against Minor Spec Enemies in general content with a solar subclass. The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness. If you already have a decent solar LMG, then you can pass. If you don't, Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk. Then, Appended Mag, Extended Mag or Flared Magwell both work as mag perks giving you more continuous shots on a single target.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For single target damage it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for boss damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. For burst damage, Relentless Strikes returns ammo on every third hit and Surrounded boosts damage by 35% if there are enemies nearby - this can be useful in crowded boss fights.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy Minor Spec add-clearing in general content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. With Explosive Head appearing in the first trait column as the support perk for a change, you have the option to go double-damage with Hatchling (unfortunately Precision Instrument only boosts precision damage so is a bit of a trap perk with Explosive Head), particularly when paired with Thread of Evolution.

First-choice PvE pick for Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception - having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag as Appended and Extended Mag. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively while, if you don't have a good backup sniper for boss damage when you run out of heavy ammo, Precision Instrument boosts your damage output by 25% after six shots, for the rest of the 14-round magazine. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

(First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Horror Story has returned and become a stasis precision auto-rifle - the first of its subtype. The stats are unexceptional, as you might expect from an event weapon but there are some trait combinations to save it. Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist. Both origin traits are more PvP-orientated, but Nadir Focus's extra range and accuracy for free is a nice little bonus.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing chunkier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag increases rate-of-fire, which is always useful. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second, Golden Tricorn can help you make the most of the Strand melee abilities (you're going to be in CQC, with a shotgun), setting yourself up for +50% damage for chunkier minors and the occasional major, and Cursed Thrall explosions on a kill.

In the second column, as the signature perk, the new-to-season-22 Sword Logic could be interesting on a shotgun - you should be able to proc a lower stack pretty easily, and use the damage boost to help activate the higher stacks.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. There's a lot of competition in the arc LMGs, and Song of Ir Yût has lower than average stats but saves itself with some nice trait perk combinations. Handling makes most weapons feel better - Fluted Barrel adds the most, but Arrowhead Brake also helps max out the recoil direction in the barrel perk slot. Maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag or Appended Mag as the perk, and then in the first column as the support perk, you can then make the most of this with Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction so you can essentially keep firing til you run out of ammo. With this set-up, you can use Bait-and-Switch as the second column signature perk for 10s of +35% damage, which is great for shorter boss damage phases (think Caretaker in Vow). Maybe not so useful with this roll, but the Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The only other current lightweight SMG is Submission (which is a stat monster), so Showrunner's stats look a bit poor by comparison, but there are still some interesting PvE rolls worth considering. Lightweights give you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed as the frame bonus to start. You can push out the range with the barrel perk - Hammer Forged Rifling or Smallbore both work well, and Ricochet Rounds pushes out the range a bit further and adds a bit more stability. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Overflow lets you get to the highest stacks of single-target damage from Target Lock in the second column as the signature perk, for beefier Minor Spec adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

// Nightshade (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Nightshade is back - the same lightweight frame as in vanilla D2, which now gives you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed, but this time as a Strand weapon. The stats are solid by comparison with other kinetic options. Start by straightening up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and then add one of the combat effect rounds - Ricochet also adds stability, but they are all useful. In the first trait column as the support park, either Enlightened Action boosts reload speed and handling to maximum in two 3-round bursts, or Outlaw maximises reload and applies a scalar. To pair with this in the second column signature slot, Collective Action boosts damage by 20% for 7s on an Elemental Pickup, or Kill Clip adds 25% damage for 5s after a precision kill. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

// Nox Perennial V (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Liquid Coils, Ionised Battery, Accelerated Coils), Envious Assassin, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name's a bit confusing - Psi (Ψ) is the 23rd letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Hermetic can mean something that's occult or mysterious and difficult to understand, relating to the legendary alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, tightly sealed, immune to external influence, or solitary like a hermit, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments.

// Geodetic HSm (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Tempered Edge, Hungry Edge, Enduring Blade), Burst Guard, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

// Dead Man's Tale (PvE first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, (Flared Magwell, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Pierceing Rounds), (Vorpal Weapon, Shoot to Loot), (Hand-Laid Stock, Fitted Stock)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. We'll be using traits to boost handling and reload speed, so you can use the barrel and mag options to push up stability as much as you can to improve control. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), (Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge, Field Prep), (Explosive Rounds, Firing Line)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Solid stats by comparison with its Precision Bow peers, and some decent PvE traits mean this is worth focusing a few Iron Banner engrams if you've not already got a decent one. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds.

The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the first choice for the barrel, with Corkscrew Rifling as an alternate choice. Appended Mag adds 2 "shots", or Tactical Mag adds one, but also helps with Stability and Reload Speed. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

// The Guiding Sight - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Guiding Sight is similar to Nightshade with multiple revisions. Originally in Vanilla, and then dropping again in Season of the Hunt. Can we get a new gun? The Guiding Sight did lose one of its biggest attractors, the scopes you can select. Now with just barrels the best one is Arrowhead Brake to bring the recoil all the way to 100. Precision Instrument will be strong on this gun because you can keep a safe distance and still keep putting out incredible damage. Enlightened Action will also bring up the gun feel and help your reload." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Persuader - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Did anyone want more Rapid-Fire Frame snipers? I hope so because Persuader is here and ready to take up some vault space. The best PvE option is actually a throwback repeat to one of my first "DPS" snipers. Does anyone remember the Long Shadow with Rapid Hit and Triple Tap being the best we could have in Forsaken until Black Armory introduced us to Firing Line. Persuader is the best option for the older perk combo, but is still outclassed by other snipers in the current Sandbox. Supremacy and Praedyth's Revenge are both incredible for damage, and any Firing Line sniper will compete with this one for decent damage." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Kept Confidence - PvE (pve,mkb,controller)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Kept Confidence is getting a lot of hype but is it worth it? We have some incredible powerhouses in the same slot. Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon."

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

// The Showrunner - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

Definitely great, but it’s a shame you’ll have to sacrifice a mod to make it feel like it’s shooting where you point it. In PvE Oversoul Edict doesn’t have the best reload perks. Keep Away and Precision Instrument are both great, Demolitionist can be strong on grenade heavy builds. The reason why I want a good reload perk like Outlaw or Rapid Hit is because of Voltshot.

// Word of Crota - PvE (controller,mkb,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh hey, another Void 180 hand cannon. I wonder how many of these we have? Not counting sunset weapons, it’s 3. But counting them in it’s 6. I guess I thought there were more. Word of Crota is an interesting 180. If you crafted a good IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 then you won’t need this one. If you didn’t craft one, then this will be a great option. Subsistence as we know allows us to bypass the reload stat and your choice of damage perks will slot in perfectly. One combo to keep an eye on is the Repulsor Brace / Destabilizing Rounds combo. It won’t scale up to GM levels but in entry level PvE activities it can put in great work." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Kept Confidence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Tactical Mag, Loose Change, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable.

There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot.

The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss.

First-choice PvE pick sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies, or burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Enhanced Explosive Light as the second column signature perk gives you 7 rockets with a 25% damage boost for the low, low costs of just picking up orbs - good for both burst and sustained damage.

I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x.

Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon.

Nation of Beasts used to be the Fakebringer of Destiny 2 giving us Outlaw and Dragonfly all wrapped into one small curated package. Now that Fatebringer is truly in the game and other weapons have been granted Outlaw and Dragonfly (or even Firefly) what sets Nation of Beasts apart? Well, not a lot. It does have access to two very strong AoE perks in Voltshot and Dragonfly, and can increase its damage through Golden Tricorn.

"New Pacific Epitaph is our newest Stasis grenade launcher, at first I was disappointed with no Chill Clip, but then I saw why. A wave frame GL. This brings back up my excitement. Wave frame grenade launchers are arguably the best GL to bring into any content. They are easy to use, reliable, and unless the architecture messes with you very easy to secure multikills with. Collective Action is the best for subclass agnostic builds. Redirection will make easy work of bigger targets, and hordes building up that damage. Kill Clip is simple because you always have to reload to fire." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Rapacious Appetite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Aggressive Frame(750) Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You’re going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

I don’t say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"Tyranny of Heaven used to be the only solar bow in the game, and its sights are really odd. In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks.

// New Pacific Epitaph (PvE first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, (Demolitionist, Lead From Gold, Unrelenting), Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist (which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw), or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. The Recoil Direction is awful, so Arrowhead Brake is pretty much a must have in the barrel. Flared Magwell fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. In general, non-endgame content Outlaw and Subsistence are both great for weapon uptime in the first trait column as your signature perk while, in the second column as the signature perk, the first stack of Golden Tricorn is easy to proc for 15% bonus damage, even if the second stack is more difficult to proc with a Strand subclass.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Until Its Return has decent stats in comparison to other kinetic slot rapid-fire shotguns and some reliable trait combinations. Handling is the best thing to aim for with the barrel perk, but range and stability can be useful too. Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 8 rounds, so there's no point looking at Appended or Extended Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow is great for doubling the mag size for running over an ammo brick, or Auto-Loading Holster means you can rely on a full magazine every time you pull it out. Surrounded in the second column as the signature perk boosts damage by 40% (+47% for the enhanced version). Alternatively, Trench Barrel boosts damage by 50% for three shots after a melee hit.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in end-game content. Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives.

Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

In the first trait column as the support perk, Subsistence keeps your magazine topped up after a kill, and Incandescent as the second column signature perk is great for add clearing and builds into your scorch and ignite Solar verbs.

// Chattering Bone (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), Rapid Hit, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for end-game use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell in the magazine add reload speed, stability and, for the former, an extra burst. Pair that with Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk, to make successive bursts easier to land and boost reload speed further. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. The range is pretty good - Fluted Barrel, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful bumps to stats, or if you want to push the range out by a few metres more, Hammer-Forged Rifling can also work in the barrel. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use). If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game activities. Loaded Question is back, and has some interesting new combinations. Being a high-impact fusion rifle, there are only five bolts, so stability is slightly less of an issue - Fluted Barrel adds useful handling, and Hammer-Forged Rifling or Smallbore add Range as the barrel perk. There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, will trigger Reservoir Burst in the second trait slot as the signature perk, a Chain Reaction-type explosions on kills to clear adds, and +25% damage to burst down Majors and maybe the occasional boss DPS phase. Plus you can build into the Arc 3.0 blinding and jolting verb kit with an arc subclass, making this a bit of a PvE Swiss-Army Knife.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities, particularly with a Strand subclass. While you've probably been melted a few times in PvP with The Immortal, it's still interesting in PvE as the first aggressive frame Strand SMG (the same subfamily as Ikelos).It's an absolute stat monster and the support perks can make it even more so, so we'll start with a range-boosting barrel, and any of the "Rounds" magazines. In the first trait column for the support perk, Threat Detector, Surplus (particularly easy to maintain with the extra melee charges from Strand), or Perpetual Motion will bump gunfeel stats up. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. In the second column, Hatchling is the natural choice to pair with a Strand subclass to generate Threadlings for add control.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel will get you to a slightly better 64. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, or Outlaw works well for a snappy reload after a crit kill. Then Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk builds into the Strand toolkit - just come to peace that they're likely to be spawned too far away to join you, if you're a Warlock.

// Basso Ostinato
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(140) Void Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Basso Ostinato is an interesting shotgun. We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Iterative Loop
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(500) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Iterative Loop needs better recoil direction. You might almost want to run counterbalance mod on it at all times. Accelerated Coils bumps up your damage per second. Lead from Gold is a very fun build and this could be a great major / champ killer. Compulsive Reloader and Voltshot would make a great pairing and clear rooms quickly. Not quite as strong as Reservoir Burst but an interesting arc alternative." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(150) Strand Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "The raid designs are incredible but I loathe typing out these names. Koraxis’s Distress is nothing special. Paracausal Affinity will bump up your damage with either a kill or a Strand kill. Easily making it one of the better choices for damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true and also brings up your reload to match. Reconstruction will bypass that, and Chain Reaction will allow you to dual flex into add clear and damage but I think Koraxis’s Distress might be best suited for a quick mag dump with bonus damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

If you like pure damage you can roll with Field Prep for faster reloads and more reserves and your choice of damage perks. Full Court for longer ranged damage phases, Explosive Light stacked with surge mods, and Vorpal for plain Jane damage.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Adaptive(120) Void Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Regnant is a great grenade launcher. It has incredible utility with Envious Assassin to overflow the magazine and Explosive Light for good dps. You can also roll a similar weapon to Veles-X with Repulsor Brace for an overshield and Destabilizing Rounds to grant volatile to your enemies. It can either clear some adds or deal some great damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Nessa's Oblation (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Tactical Mag, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Void subclass synergy in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still be effective to control beefier minors, and majors. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. It's unusual to be able to roll two Void perks, so the opportunity to roll Repulsor Brace in the first trait column as your support perk, for damage reduction void overshields, and Destabilizing Rounds as your signature perk in the second to spread volatility on a kill is difficult to pass up. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Majors in end-game content.

First-choice PvE roll for Majors in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Acasia's Dejection is no different - this is the best legendary trace rifle as at v7.0.0.6.

// Battle Scar (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds), Shoot to Loot, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling), (Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Envious Assassing, Fourth Time's The Charm, Rapid Hit), (Firing Line, Focused Fury)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. (??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag. As the support perk, in the first trait column, Feeding Frenzy boosts reload speed further after kills - your solar ignition kills from Incandescent will add to the stacks, particularly when paired with Ember of Ashes.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid.

Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling.

Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight.

// Caretaker (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest). As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork.

In-band stats for a high-impact pulse rifle - there's already plenty of range so use your barrel to fill out your preferred gunfeel stats (you can never go wrong with additional handling and stability). With one eye to Voltshot in the final column, you want reload speed as high as possible so Flared Magwell or Light Mag, and Compulsive Reloader or Keep Away with a Reload Speed Masterwork should get Voltshot procced and ready to use as quickly as possible after a kill.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. We've seen rapid-fire shotguns a lot - maybe not the play for end-game activities where you're probably in trouble if you're close enough to use it, but useful for bursting down a major or champion once stunned. The ranges on shotguns are compressed, to look for a handling or stability barrel, and Tactical Mag is easily the best of the mag perks. Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too. In the last column, Destabilizing Rounds spreads volatility to surrounding adds on a kill to synergise with Void subclass verbs.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage.

Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with rapid kills - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats (so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time). Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis subclasses in end-game content. Even nerfed, the Veist Stinger origin trait will still be useful occasionally. Jararaca has poor stats, unfortunately, by comparison with other rapid-fire and Veist rapid-fire scout rifles, but it does offer Stasis synergy. First, ou'll need Arrowhead Brake to sort out the recoil direction. Any of the combat effect rounds will help - if you keep firing until the end of the magazine, the frame perk will help reloads, so you can live without a reload speed-boosting magazine perk, especially with Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion in the first trait column. Finally, for Stasis synergy, in the second trait column Headstone's crystals work with your aspects and fragments.

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Seventh Seraph Carbine
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don’t know what it is about this weapon but I could never get behind it. Maybe the second iteration will change that. Reconstruction and frenzy are the absolute best perks to look for. Being able to passively double your magazine and have a damage bonus all while the weapon is stowed is too good to pass up."

// Long Arm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A legendary Dead Man’s Tale? [...] Having Long Arm be arc opens up loadouts and possibilities while still retaining some of the same identity. Rapid hit and explosive payload are the tried and true combo. Coupled with Long Arm’s intrinsic dual loader will make shooting and downtime a breeze." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Terminus Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Terminus Horizon will be an interesting weapon to use. Being a slow firing weapon it can probably take advantage of target lock better than the other archetypes purely because the weapon takes longer to empty its magazine comparatively. Having 73 bullets at maximum capacity and laying into a boss with triple tap, demolitionist for instant reloads or rapid hit for the bonuses to stability and reload. There are few times I will fully recommend a high-impact machine gun, but Terminus Horizon is definitely one of them.." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Terminus Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Terminus Horizon will be an interesting weapon to use. Being a slow firing weapon it can probably take advantage of target lock better than the other archetypes purely because the weapon takes longer to empty its magazine comparatively. Having 73 bullets at maximum capacity and laying into a boss with triple tap, demolitionist for instant reloads or rapid hit for the bonuses to stability and reload. There are few times I will fully recommend a high-impact machine gun, but Terminus Horizon is definitely one of them.." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Path of Least Resistance
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think the Path of Least Resistance is going to be a crowd favorite. Adaptive munitions to crush shields and voltshot to clear rooms. There is the classic “Musketeer” combo of stats for all and one for all. As well as some decent damage through focused fury. Subsistence I think is the best for mobbing but without a direct damage bonus you might be a bit underwhelmed with its performance." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This is probably the best timeline the Ikelos hand cannon has seen but it is still underwhelming. Precision frame hand cannons do not do enough damage in PvE to warrant use outside out bounties or low-level PvE. They just simply don’t scale well enough for my tastes.

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] it still probably won’t make much of a splash this season either. In PvE the best shotguns are pin-point frames for damage, and dealer’s choice for general use. I do like rapid-fire frames with one-two punch builds as you don’t need a lot to hit max magazine and grave robber for “free” reloads. The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler. I just don’t think with all the rapid-fire frame shotguns and PvE centered shotguns the Ikelos will really shine." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

You get to decide what works and what doesn’t. Frenzy will scale up a bit better than voltshot for PvE, but voltshot will clear a room quicker." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// IKELOS_SR_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I still have my season 11 Ikelos sniper. I still use it and I don’t think there’s a large reason for me to grind out the crafted version. For those who don’t have the 2nd version of the Ikelos sniper, overflow and focused fury are a very fun combo for maximizing your damage per magazine. I prefer high-impact reserves and fourth time’s the charm for ammo refunding. Something about damage numbers going up consistently makes my smooth brain happy."

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Path of Least Resistance
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think the Path of Least Resistance is going to be a crowd favorite. Adaptive munitions to crush shields and voltshot to clear rooms. There is the classic “Musketeer” combo of stats for all and one for all. As well as some decent damage through focused fury. Subsistence I think is the best for mobbing but without a direct damage bonus you might be a bit underwhelmed with its performance." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This is probably the best timeline the Ikelos hand cannon has seen but it is still underwhelming. Precision frame hand cannons do not do enough damage in PvE to warrant use outside out bounties or low-level PvE. They just simply don’t scale well enough for my tastes.

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] it still probably won’t make much of a splash this season either. In PvE the best shotguns are pin-point frames for damage, and dealer’s choice for general use. I do like rapid-fire frames with one-two punch builds as you don’t need a lot to hit max magazine and grave robber for “free” reloads. The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler. I just don’t think with all the rapid-fire frame shotguns and PvE centered shotguns the Ikelos will really shine." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

You get to decide what works and what doesn’t. Frenzy will scale up a bit better than voltshot for PvE, but voltshot will clear a room quicker." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// IKELOS_SR_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I still have my season 11 Ikelos sniper. I still use it and I don’t think there’s a large reason for me to grind out the crafted version. For those who don’t have the 2nd version of the Ikelos sniper, overflow and focused fury are a very fun combo for maximizing your damage per magazine. I prefer high-impact reserves and fourth time’s the charm for ammo refunding. Something about damage numbers going up consistently makes my smooth brain happy."

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Hung Jury SR4
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Does that make this version the best version yet? Kinda not really. All the base stats are the same The new Hung Jury now has the origin traits. It lost bottomless grief, one for all and adrenaline junkie. All fantastic perks depending on what you like to use. In their place we received no distractions, and frenzy. Frenzy is a fantastic addition and I love seeing it on more weapons, but losing things to not have as strong of a weapon next time around is a let down."

// Hung Jury SR4 (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Does that make this version the best version yet? Kinda not really. All the base stats are the same The new Hung Jury now has the origin traits. It lost bottomless grief, one for all and adrenaline junkie. All fantastic perks depending on what you like to use. In their place we received no distractions, and frenzy. Frenzy is a fantastic addition and I love seeing it on more weapons, but losing things to not have as strong of a weapon next time around is a let down."

// Wendigo GL3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Wendigo GL3 (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Blowout
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal. There isn’t much that this rocket does that others don’t besides dropping more frequently and having more perks with resets. The same “get damage perk, get reload perk” applies to Blowout. Frenzy, lasting impression, or chain reaction for add clear are all fantastic options. Field prep for near instant reloads, demolitionist for instant reloads, and ambitious assassin for bigger magazine are all the best in their slot." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Dark Decider
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I do not know what it is about the Veist style rapid fire frames, but I vastly prefer them over non-Veist ones. Dark Decider is almost a carbon copy of my favorite rapid fire frame of all time Hollow Earth from Year 1. Subsistence and voltshot are going to be the roll to get on Dark Decider for PvE. Golden tricorn is fantastic but requires a bit more thinking to maintain 2x." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Unwavering Duty (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Wendigo GL3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Blowout
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal. There isn’t much that this rocket does that others don’t besides dropping more frequently and having more perks with resets. The same “get damage perk, get reload perk” applies to Blowout. Frenzy, lasting impression, or chain reaction for add clear are all fantastic options. Field prep for near instant reloads, demolitionist for instant reloads, and ambitious assassin for bigger magazine are all the best in their slot." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Exalted Truth (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This is going to be Palindrome-lite. It won’t have the same all-encompassing perk pool that made Palindrome so good in all aspects of the game. But being a void hand cannon that can take adept mods, has frenzy and alacrity can come in handy when in GMs or master content. While it’s not a direct 1:1 it can fill a hole if you missed Palindrome before it was taken from the loot pool." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front’s poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon."

Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you’re in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible.

With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS."

Stability is the play for controller, to help keep your barrel pointed at what you're shooting at, and then with the combined goodness of Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber and Ricochet Rounds, Seraph Rounds is a clear first choice in the mag. If you're looking at end-game add-clearing, Threat Detector will speed up your reloads and boost your stability while you're in CQC or Perpetual Motion will do the same just for moving about a bit and Surrounded boosts damage by 36.5% and the enhanced version by 47%. But, even though this is a great roll, you'll still know in your heart that you really wanted Voltshot...

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for end-game Minor clearing. The only easily available Aggressive SMG in the game (other than Xur selling an Extraordinary Rendition - you have a good one, you probably won't need a Cold Front). Option of Hakke Breach Armaments or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. Very poor stability, so for controller Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore is a must, together with Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell to get it as high as possible.

There are no real holes in the stats, but Fluted Barrel or Smallbore provide nice boosts in the barrel.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for Minor add clear. No second origin trait, but Dawning Surprise helps you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so - ideal in keeping you alive in CQC. In the blade slot, Jagged Edge to maximises damage or Tempered Edge balances a bit of extra damage and ammo, for all-round utility. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation in the guard slot, to get your heavy attack up as quickly as possible. Unrelenting works for an add-clear weapon build, recovering your health from both the perk itself and the origin trait.

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Nothing beats the holiday whimsy of disintegrating your enemies in a void-powered explosion, getting a round auto-loaded, and then doing it all over again :) Glacioclasm hits hard, but it also handles like a brick. Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds.

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats and a stellar PvE perk pool make this an LMG worth chasing. You can choose to sort the recoil with Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel, or improve stability with Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. Most mag choices could have a role - boost your magazine size with Appended or Extended Mag, reload speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag, or both with Tactical Mag. For add clear, you need a reload perk or mag extending perk in your first trait column - Subsistence, Fourth Times The Charm, Reconstruction, Rapid Hit or Feeding Frenzy all work with good old Rampage to boost damage by up to 33%. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

// Bequest (PvE first-choice roll)
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for major or boss damage in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). The standout stat here is impact, which is 10 points higher than for any other adaptive sword, which makes it competitive in end-game content for chunkier adds. Jagged Edge adds more damage and Swordmaster's Guard increases you heavy attack charge rate. For major or boss damage in a crowd - think Duality - Relentless Strikes returns ammo for every three hits, and Surrounded boosts damage by 36.5% (47% for the Enhanced Park. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Good overall stats, but has 1 less point of Zoom than its competitors, so you might need to add a little extra range to make up for that with the barrel and mag choices - Extended Barrel does this and take the Recoil Direction to a maximum 100. Ricochet Rounds then pushes Range out by a total of about 1.25m, and smooths things with a dab of Stability too. Perpetual Motion (anywhere) or Ensemble (in a fireteam) both help with gunfeel stats and, if you haven't already got an Osmosis SMG (you really only need one in your Vault), it'll give you another option for weapon energy type, which can be useful in solo endgame content.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Blood Feud
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Blood Feud looks to be the best weapon from Plunder activities. Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play.

// Boudica-c
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “This is a fun little piece. Boudica-C is in the precision frame, meaning the slowest firing but hardest hitting sidearm archetype. it is a fine line between an overpowered sidearm and an underpowered hand cannon. This bridges the gap nicely while still feeling like a good sidearm. Again, I have to let you know sidearms are not meta, nor are they the best choice for middle to high-tier content. But they are damn fun and you should use what you like.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Brigand's Law
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I love me some 450 sidearms, they are goofy and fun. Brigand's Law is no exception to that rule. With surrounded and feeding frenzy or threat detector you will be right up in the mix of things and getting that nice damage off. Definitely take this into a GM and let me know how it handles. Jokes aside, this sidearm is pure ecstasy, nothing less. Fun but not ideal in any serious content.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Cry Mutiny
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Blast Radius “Cry Mutiny is not fantastic at any one thing being both grenade and melee focused. But it is unique in being one of three heavy weapons with incandescent. Of the three this is the easiest to get and one of the better weapons to get incandescent on. Roar of the Bear coming from Iron Banner is a rocket, which has better use cases. Fixed Odds coming from the Duality dungeon and feels impossible to farm for. Cry Mutiny gives this to players in an easy to get format.   For PvE I would use it with Solar builds, especially as one of your minor killing weapons. For PvP I would look elsewhere. The perks do not lend themselves to the best experience.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Taipan-4fr
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload or Charge Time “Taipan-4fr is incredible for what it is. it is a craftable linear fusion rifle with perks that compare and get it close to things like Reed's Regret and Stormchaser. It lowers the barrier for entry and to be competitive if you do not play trials or dungeons. I love this for Bungie. More ways for players to get competitive loot out of the gate. Firing line, frenzy, or focused fury are all incredibly strong options. Rapid hit makes it easier to land consecutive crits, clown cartridge will overflow your magazine, and if you can remember to crouch field prep will be your best option for reserves and a fast reload.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

While it is great to cross compare weapons like that, all it does is allow for loadout diversity.

// Something New
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This Stasis weapon brings us solid perks like Headstone or Demolitionist. Stats for All plus Headstone is ridiculously fun. A quick warning. the intrinsic trait will make reload-based perks (like MKC and Tunnel Vision) near useless in team activities. For magazine options, choose getting more shots or increasing Stability/Reload, either or both will help combat common Aggressive frame issues. Barrels are similar: focusing on Stability and Handling over Range will make this gun feel much better in combat." Recommended MW: Reload or Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want!

Then shape your own solar Fatebringer with Explosive Payload in the first trait slot which, adds flinch and damage, and is useful to disrupt Overload Champions with a matching mod, and Firefly (which should have the spec mod effects rolled in soon by Bungie) in the second.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing.

// Chain of Command
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The unique factor is Osmosis to change its damage type from stasis to whatever subclass you happen to be on. A real jack of all trades. Unfortunately it is the true master of one. Having both adrenaline junkie and demolitionist really elevate it with grenade builds on Void 3.0 or some Solar 3.0 builds, but I would rather have either a dedicated “big-deeps” machine gun or an add clear machine gun with firefly or dragonfly. I don’t really find myself using machine guns for add clearing, but having a very reliable weapon for grenade builds is never a bad option. I think it would pair best with Void 3.0 and lead from gold builds." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Riptide
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Crucible focus weapon this season is Riptide. A rapid-fire fusion in the “kinetic” slot. Deliverance has some competition now. Similar to Season of the Cartesian Coordinate vorpal weapon is the best in slot perk to chase after. With 12 perks in that column you’ll just have to pray to RNGesus to even see the perk. The two very close second and third are chill clip for Stasis oriented builds (or general add control builds), and frenzy for neutral damage across all enemy types. I find frenzy works best on primary weapons, but a full arsenal of frenzy weapons means you won’t ever drop your damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Wizened Rebuke
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I absolutely loved using my firmly planted and tap the trigger Wizened Rebuke back in the Forsaken era of Seasons 6 and 7. With the fusion changes I would highly recommend cleaning up the recoil direction to make sure that you have the easiest time controlling the burst. For PvE similar to Riptide you will want vorpal weapon for the best success. Subsistence helps keep the voops going." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring.

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option. (though you could always craft a Fel Taradiddle)." Recommended MW - Draw Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Without Remorse
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Without Remorse is an interesting shotgun. It competes with everyone’s favorite Seventh Seraph CQC-12. Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on. Having a 200% damage increase to your non-ranged melee is incredibly fun for destroying majors or chunky red bars. Pair that with auto-loading holster to keep your mag topped off is the way to go."

// The Long Walk (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Rapid Fire Snipers are, as at S17 v4.1.5.2, the best DPS option, but aggressive frames still put out decent damage. Keep shots on target with a stability barrel, then Appended Mag gets you to the max mag size, Clown Cartridge and Firing Line are the best way to get damage out as fast as possible in a fireteam. Drops from the first (Phalanx Echo) encounter if you're looking to farm it.

// Staccato-46 (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 22. PvE first-choice roll for end-game add clear. You probably won't get much use out of the Suros origin trait in PvE, but this is a surprisingly competitive choice for the energy slot as at season 17. Improve Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Triple Tap extends your mag, and Incandescent pairs well with Solar 3.0 builds to add and spread scorch stacks.

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB / Controller / PvE): "The Title is an interesting SMG. It's got some great synergy with different builds like the All for All, or grave robber and swashbuckler. Vorpal is always a good choice for general use, but I find SMGs can't really take advantage of it. If you have a good Funnelweb, you can make this work with different builds, but for overall usage I don't know if I'd take The Title over my frenzy Funnelweb."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cataclysmic is an interesting linear fusion rifle [...] While it doesn’t directly beat out Reed’s Regret in terms of damage it possibly could. It really depends on your damage window. Firing line will do longer burst damage, but if you don’t have mag extending perks you won’t be able to keep up with Cataclysmic. Fourth time’s the charm will let you deal damage for longer if you spec your Cataclysmic the right way, and you can craft the exact roll you want.".

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. [...] Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it’s not ideal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cantata-57
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cantata-57 feels good, and that’s at base. Everything else just builds this gun up to be a beast in PvE content; rivaling even Fatebringer. Ideally you’d want rapid hit and vorpal to cover your majors and minors, but timed payload is a great PvE perk similar to explosive payload. The delay in PvE is negligible and you get nothing but benefits. Rapid hit only works if the bullet portion hits crits but with the aim assist and PvE hit boxes you shouldn’t have a horrible time getting rapid hit going."

Having access to firing line and fourth time’s the charm is a real benefit to those who haven’t gotten a good ikelos, started recently, or simply prefer adaptives to rapid-fire frame snipers. Auto-loading holster and vorpal weapon are great for solo activities or if you’re against Rhulk and separated from your fireteam. Having the ability to have decent damage and almost a “fire and forget” weapon while maintaining movement or solitude just feels like a good weapon to keep in your arsenal."

The one thing that Come to Pass does that is better than Herod-C is handle shielded enemies with ease. Herod-C can clear rooms with headstone, Come to Pass deals with champs and shields better than most other autos in its archetype. Adaptive munitions is very strong and triple tap once the shield is gone can artificially extend your mag to make it even easier to kill those higher health bar enemies.".

// BxR-55 Battler
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "the BxR-55 Battler is the best feeling 450 pulse in the entirety of Destiny, the shortcomings come from being a 450 frame. A push one way or the other could easily tip the scale into a dominant adaptive or rapid-fire frame meta with how this frame slips right between them. Does it feel fantastic? For sure. Is it meta breaking or a complete game changer? Not at all. To ensure it does feel good, you’re going to want to get Arrowhead Brake to get that sweet 100 recoil direction. Then slot the new full auto retrofit mod and go to town." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Retraced Path
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "I think Tactical Battery is the best option for most use cases as it adds range, stability, and reload speed. Subsistence makes it a mini-Prometheus Lens without the AoE damage. But with a perk like Frenzy or Golden Tricorn you can easily get better damage numbers. This is a welcome addition to anyone’s arsenal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Half-Truths
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "The key to this sword is Eager Edge.

// Eyasluna
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Is it better than Fatebringer (Adept) and Palindrome (Adept)? I don’t think so. But it can definitely hang and seeing one isn’t a direct handicap. Eyasluna has an ease of use that the other two just simply don’t have. [...] When comparing normal base models it becomes even better as there’s no adept mods to socket and the farmability of this [...] will make it a very easy choice for a lot of the more casual community. [...] For PvE the tried and true pairing of a reload perk and a damage perk will be your bread and butter. If you want to get saucy something like Headstone or Harmony could be good for specific builds." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Matador-64
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Let me preface this by saying precision shotguns are not the best choice for any content. That being said, Matador 64 might be your best option depending on your roll. For PvE One-Two Punch is still my favorite choice for the sheer damage you can get with your melees."

// 1000 Yard Stare
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Unfortunately this sniper does not compete in PvE compared to other snipers. I wouldn’t be using a sniper to clear rank-and-file enemies. And I wouldn’t use this sniper for boss damage. It does have Triple Tap and Demolitionist for faster mag dumps, but being an adaptive frame means it sits in the middle of burst damage and sustained damage."

//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "This is probably the best thing to come this season. It’s an incredible design. A second spin-to-win sword and comes with Chain Reaction? Heck yeah! Arguably One for All is going to be better on this sword as you can spin in a group and instantly get full stacks. BUT sword go boom? Sword go boom. I’m excited."

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind. You could definitely opt for some of the other perks here too as nothing really screams PvE."|tags:pve,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."

// Last Perdition (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good controller) - "[...] Last Perdition is basically Bygones but Void, with sights instead of barrels! [...] slightly better stability, and slightly worse range and recoil direction."
