# Wishlist Filter Descriptions

## How Filters Work

Each weapon roll in Voltron is given tags based on its valuable text. Valuable text is all text after "tags:" or text inside "(...)" and "[...]" if no "tags:" is found.

## Filter Descriptions

**Input** - MKB (Mouse and Keyboard) or CTR (Controller). If a roll isn't tagged as MKB or CTR, MKB is assumed.

**Gamemode** - PvE or PvP. If a roll isn't tagged as PvE or PvP, PvE is assumed.

**Author** - The name(s) of the author(s) for the roll. Wishlists can filter by multiple authors.

**God** - Shows rolls tagged as "God". Extremely strict and relies on rolls being properly tagged as "God".

**!Backup** - Removes rolls tagged as "Backup Roll". Less strict version of "God".

**Perks** - Limits perks to 3rd and 4th columns and origin traits. Removes perks in 1st and 2nd columns.

**Dupes** - Removes any roll that isn't recommended at least twice. Rolls for a weapon recommended only once won't be removed.
