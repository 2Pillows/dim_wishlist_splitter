# Wishlist Filter Notes

## How Filters Work

Each roll is read from the Voltron file and given tags based on the words found in the roll description. The words used to determine tags are either the ones denoted after "tags:" or ones inside parentheses or brackets if no "tags:" is present.

## Filter Descriptions

**Input** - MKB (Mouse and Keyboard) or CTR (Controller)

**Gamemode** - PvE or PvP

**Author** - The name of the author for the roll.

**God** - Only shows rolls that have "god" as a tag

**!Backup** - Removes any roll that has "backup roll" or a similar phrase.

**Perks** - Removes the 1st and 2nd column perks from all weapons on the list. Only 3rd, 4th, and origin traits will be included.

**Dupes** - Removes any roll that doesn't appear at least 2 times.
