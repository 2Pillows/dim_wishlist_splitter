// Gunburn - PvP Kill-chaining Good 1
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Bewildering Burst), (Target Lock, Kinetic Tremors)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for kill-chaining in 6v6 game modes, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX. Gunburn is a lightweight SMG, so you'll get the +20 to Mobility and ×1.0625 forward movement speed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (11c 1b) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.867s (9c 5b). The stats, particularly when you compare them to best in slot options like Multimach - particularly the one less zoom - are around 5 points lower, but you do have slightly better Airborne Effectiveness and enhanceable barrel and magazine perks at Tier 4 and 5 to narrow the gap. Even though Range is quite compressed, you'll want to push it out to be competitive - the Handling is high enough to consider Extended Barrel, which also maxes out Recoil Direction, or Hammer-Forged Rifling. Combine that with Accurized Rounds as the magazine perk and a Range Masterwork and mod, and you take the ADS range from 16.70m before damage dropoff up to 20.34m. You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. The unique trait perk is Bewildering Burst, which isn't easy to incorporate. Reloading after killing an opponent prepares a disorienting grenade to launch a flashbang above the next target, which detonates to disorient enemies in a 9m radius. On an SMG that means you'll need to jiggle peek out from cover to hit an opponent, back into cover for the flashbang, and then re-engage once they're blinded. In the second column, Target Lock effectively extends useful range, and makes missing a crit less punishing, or Kinetic Tremors is triggered after 14 hits for additional target and AoE damage. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed. Recommended MW: Range, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost Range, Zoom or Airborne Effectiveness depending ou your play style.|tags:PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller

// Gunburn - PvP Kill-chaining Good 2
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Pugilist), (Binary Orbit, Wellspring)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-KillChain M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for kill-chaining in 6v6 game modes with a melee build, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX. Gunburn is a lightweight SMG, so you'll get the +20 to Mobility and ×1.0625 forward movement speed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (11c 1b) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.867s (9c 5b).

You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. For melee builds, Pugilist generates chunks of melee ability energy on kills. On light based subclasses, you can use melee kills to proc Binary Orbit which is like a better Harmony, boosting damage by ×1.25 for 8.5s on ability and weapon kills of the opposite energy type. Alternatively, if you're looking to go all-in to a melee build and need a legendary Monte Carlo, Wellspring generates additional chunk ability energy, shared between any uncharged abilities. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed.

// Gunburn - PvP Duelling Good 1
// (Extended Barrel), (Accurized Rounds), (Lone Wolf, Threat Detector), (Target Lock, Kinetic Tremors)
//notes:Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/@cammycakesgaming (PvP PvP-Duel M+KB Controller): Good PvP roll for duelling in 3v3 game modes, if you'd like an alternative to Multimach CCX. Gunburn is a lightweight SMG, so you'll get the +20 to Mobility and ×1.0625 forward movement speed. As per the @hugowo_ spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/, at 100 Weapon attribute, best base TTK is 0.733s (11c 1b) and 70% accuracy adjusted TTK is 0.867s (9c 5b).

You can see the in-game effect of stat changes at https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for yourself. For duelling, in the first trait perk column, Lone Wolf is great for flanking, and the gunfeel boosts scale multiplicatively with the Search Party origin trait, or Threat Detector provides information on enemies close by when ADSed (except when they're invisible), as well as usefully boosting Handling, Stability and Reload Speed. In the second column, Target Lock effectively extends useful range, and makes missing a crit less punishing, or Kinetic Tremors is triggered after 14 hits for additional target and AoE damage. For the Origin Trait, Search Party pairs well with the Lightweight Frame, giving ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed.

// Gunburn - PvE Minor god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling), (Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Threat Detector), (Kinetic Tremors, Ancillary Ordinance, One For All)
//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for add group control in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Gunburn is a lightweight frame SMG - the first ever from the Veist foundry - which are rated B-Tier for endgame PvE by @TheAegisRelic tiering spreadsheet https://linktr.ee/TheAegisRelic, and provides +20 to your hidden Mobility attribute and a ×1.0625 forward movement scalar. The stats are good by comparison with its peers, and are helped further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and magazine perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/3431536253 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. From the @Mossy-Max spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/ base Magazine size is 37 (max 44). Range is compressed on SMGs, so look for a Handling boost from your barrel perk on M+KB, or Stability on Controller. In the magazine slot, a perk to bump Reload Speed is pretty much the only option. With an SMG, you'll pretty much always be engaging in CQC ranges, so Threat Detector is a natural first trait perk column choice - it procs per enemy within 15m up to ×2 stacks, with two stacks providing +40 Stability, +60 Reload Speed with a ×0.81 animation scalar and +100 Handling (+44, +64 and +100 respectively, when enhanced). For add group control, in the second column, Kinetic Tremors emits three 6m AoE kinetic shockwaves after 14 hits (13 enhanced) within 3s of each other, which are treated as weapon damage and inherit damage boosts. Requiring a bit more setup, Ancillary Ordinance builds up to ×5 stacks on elemental kills or kills of elementally-debuffed enemies with abilities or elemental weapons - then, on a kinetic weapon kill, a stack is used to spawn a micro-missile on the corpse to track to an enemy within 30m. With no stacks, kinetic kills on elementally-debuffed enemies instantly spawn a micro-missile. For the Origin Trait, there's either Veist Stinger which provides a 2% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine or Search Party which applies a ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed when there are no allies within 15m. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Range is compressed on SMGs, so look for a Handling boost from your barrel perk on M+KB, or Stability on Controller. In the magazine slot, a perk to bump Reload Speed is pretty much the only option. If you're on a light subclass, running a melee build, then Pugilist generates chunk melee ability energy on kills and +35 Handling for 3s after dealing melee damage, which you can use with Binary Orbit to provide a ×1.25 damage boost for a refreshable 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) after a kill with an opposing elemental alignment. For the Origin Trait, there's either Veist Stinger which provides a 2% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine or Search Party which applies a ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed when there are no allies within 15m.

Range is compressed on SMGs, so look for a Handling boost from your barrel perk on M+KB, or Stability on Controller. In the magazine slot, a perk to bump Reload Speed is pretty much the only option. For add control, in the first trait perk column, Bewildering Burst procs for 6s (7s when enhanced) after finishing a reload following a kill, and then on the next hit launches a flashbang above the target that does damage and disorients enemies within 9m for 3.5s. You can use that to create a loop with One For All's damage boost of ×1.35 for a non-refreshable 10s (11s enhanced) after hitting three separate targets within 3s of each to kill the group of disoriented enemies and re-proc the flashbang. You might also consider Kinetic Tremors against tougher enemies which emits three 6m AoE kinetic shockwaves after 14 hits (13 when enhanced) within 3s of each other, which are treated as weapon damage, inheriting damage boosts and also proccing weapon effects like Bewildering Burst. For the Origin Trait, there's either Veist Stinger which provides a 2% chance per hit to refill 25% of the magazine or Search Party which applies a ×0.85 ADS animation scalar and ×1.1 ADS movement speed when there are no allies within 15m.

// Drang - PvE Minor god 1
// (Extended Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Full Bore), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), (Disruption Break), (Binary Orbit, Master of Arms, Frenzy)
//notes://notes:Inspired by @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for clearing minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly when paired with Sturm in the kinetic slot. Drang is good as far as primary sidearms go, but they do still fall in the shadow of their Micro missile frame cousins. This is an adaptive frame underneath, but has the additional Together Forever frame intrinsic, which loads overcharged rounds into Sturm on kills. In return, kills with Sturm refill energy slot weapons from reserves and, with the Helping Hands catalyst boost Range by +18 and Handling by +40 for faster swaps. The stats are good by comparison with its adaptive frame peers, which are helped at Tier 4/5 when barrel and magazine perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/358190158 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. From the @Mossy-Max spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/ base Magazine size is 18 (max 20). Handling is pretty good, so on M+KB, you can probably look to extend the range a bit with the barrel perk - you can squeeze another 1-2m before damage drop-off depending on how much you invest into it, even at the cost of a Handling malus. With the Sturm pairing to bypass reload, you can use the magazine perk to boost magazine size. The first column trait perk that stands out for the pairing with Sturm is Disruption Break which increases kinetic damage by ×1.5 after breaking an elemental shield. For damage, Binary Orbit - provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) after a kill with an opposing elemental alignment - Stasis, Strand or, when paired with Sturm, kinetic. Alternatively, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active or Frenzy boosts Handling and Reload Speed by +100 and damage by ×1.15 for a refreshable 7.2s after being in combat for 12s - that's dealing or taking damage. For the Origin Trait, there's either Vanguard Vindication to provide up to 3 stacks of ×0.98/0.96/0.94 damage reduction for 10s, for kills within 20s of using a class ability, or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s, after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s.

Drang is good as far as primary sidearms go, but they do still fall in the shadow of their Micro missile frame cousins.

With the Sturm pairing to bypass reload, you can use the magazine perk to boost magazine size. To pair with solar builds, you have the traditional trait perk pairings available. In the first column, Heal Clip provides ×2 Cure (140 HP), and ×1 Cure on allies within 15m, when you finish a reload within ~5.3s (~5.5s when enhanced) after a kill. Then in the second there's Incandescent which spreads +30 Scorch stacks within 4m on a red bar Minor add kill (+40 stacks within 8m for orange and yellow bars, +45 when enhanced). Alternatively, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you have a solar ability to apply scorch initially, otherwise it'll take x* hits (y* when enhanced) to apply +10 stacks with +10 added on each additional hit to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For the Origin Trait, there's either Vanguard Vindication to provide up to 3 stacks of ×0.98/0.96/0.94 damage reduction for 10s, for kills within 20s of using a class ability, or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s, after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s.

MIDA Mini-Tool is a lightweight frame underneath, providing the usual +20 to your hidden Mobility stat and ×1.0625 to base movement speed, but is officially a MIDA Synergy frame, which when paired with MIDA Multi-Tool boosts sprint speed by ×1.1 and progress the MIDA Software Trait with kills.

For damage, Binary Orbit - provides a ×1.25 damage boost for 8.5s (10.5s enhanced) after a kill with an opposing elemental alignment - Stasis, Strand or, when paired with Sturm, kinetic. Alternatively, Master of Arms provides ×1.15 damage for 7s (8s enhanced) after a kill with any weapon, with a second stack of ×1.25 for 4s (5s enhanced) on any kills with the first stack active or Frenzy boosts Handling and Reload Speed by +100 and damage by ×1.15 for a refreshable 7.2s after being in combat for 12s - that's dealing or taking damage. For the Origin Trait, there's either Vanguard Vindication to provide up to 3 stacks of ×0.98/0.96/0.94 damage reduction for 10s, for kills within 20s of using a class ability, or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s, after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s. Recommended MW: Stability, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost mag size, weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame Controller

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written as at v9.1.5.1 PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for fireteam support and clearing minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly when paired with Sturm in the kinetic slot and using a solar build. Drang is good as far as primary sidearms go, but they do still fall in the shadow of their Micro missile frame cousins. This is an adaptive frame underneath, but has the additional Together Forever frame intrinsic, which loads overcharged rounds into Sturm on kills. In return, kills with Sturm refill energy slot weapons from reserves and, with the Helping Hands catalyst boost Range by +18 and Handling by +40 for faster swaps. The stats are good by comparison with its adaptive frame peers, which are helped at Tier 4/5 when barrel and magazine perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/358190158 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. From the @Mossy-Max spreadsheet at https://www.destiny2.science/ base Magazine size is 18 (max 20). With the fire rate, a bit of assistance with controlling recoil is helpful to control your reticule, particularly on Controller. With the Sturm pairing to bypass reload, you can use the magazine perk to boost magazine size, but if not, look for one that helps with reloads. To pair with solar builds, you have the traditional trait perk pairings available. In the first column, Heal Clip provides ×2 Cure (140 HP), and ×1 Cure on allies within 15m, when you finish a reload within ~5.3s (~5.5s when enhanced) after a kill. Then in the second there's Incandescent which spreads +30 Scorch stacks within 4m on a red bar Minor add kill (+40 stacks within 8m for orange and yellow bars, +45 when enhanced). Alternatively, Burning Ambition works better to build ignitions on tougher targets if you have a solar ability to apply scorch initially, otherwise it'll take 14 hits (10 when enhanced) to apply +10 stacks with +10 added on additional hits to build towards an ignition. All of the scorch stacks are increased by ×1.5 with Ember of Ashes. For the Origin Trait, there's either Vanguard Vindication to provide up to 3 stacks of ×0.98/0.96/0.94 damage reduction for 10s, for kills within 20s of using a class ability, or Roar of Battle which grants +10 Stability and Handling for 6s, after dealing or taking damage every 0.5s or so for 2s.

//notes:Inspired by @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for boss damage rotations and backup boss damage in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Lance Ephemeral is a rapid frame sniper - the best subfamily for damage output and offering the ×0.8 animation modifier when reloading from an empty mag - but is in the kinetic slot where you've probably got Mint Retrograde equipped, unfortunately. The stats are good by comparison with its peers, including a lowish 40 Zoom, and they're helped further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and magazine perks are enhanced - see https://d2foundry.gg/w/688593230 for how the weapon stats impact in-game performance. From @mossy_max's spreadsheet (https://destiny2.science/reserves), base mag size is 5 (max 6) and total ammo is 26 (max 31). With boss damage rotation weapons, Handling affects ready, ADS and stow speeds, so that's what you're looking for with the barrel perk, while you can use the magazine perk to max out the number of shots. For a boss damage roll, look for first trait perk column options to minimise reloads and reduce downtime. Envious Arsenal refills the magazine from reserves on dealing damage with both of your other weapons, Rewind Rounds refills 60% of hits landed (70% when enhanced) from reserves, or Fourth Time's the Charm loads 2 shots from reserves after 4 crits within 2s (3s when enhanced) of each other. For damage, in the second column, Bait and Switch boosts damage by ×1.3 for 10s (11s when enhanced) for doing damage with your other two weapons, so is your first choice pairing with Envious Arsenal, or Elemental Honing - grants an escalating stack of damage up to ×1.35 for 20s (23s when enhanced) for each elemental damage type inflicted, which can be refreshed with a new damage type until you've run through all 5. The Frame of Reference Origin Trait stacks up to ×5 times on kills, providing up to ×1.07 damage and boosts to Reload Speed and Range for 8s, with the timer pausing when the weapon's stowed.

Pure Recollection is only the second heavy burst shotgun and is unfortunately not great for damage output. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are decent, and are improved further at Tier 4/5 when barrel and mag perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that 65 Range equates to 7.69m hipfire and ADS, 41 Stability is ×1.0262 flinch resist, 58 Handling is a 0.35s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.37 stow speed and 67 Reload Speed is a 0.59s per shell reload. According to MossyMax's spreadsheetat on destiny.science, Magazine Size is 12 (max 16) and total ammo is 36 (max 36). For weapons in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation, Handling and Magazine size are the weapon stats that need boosting by the barrel and magazine perks. The traditional trait perk combination of Envious Arsenal, refilling the magazine after hitting targets with your other weapons with Bait and Switch providing ×1.3 damage for 10s (11 when enhanced) on the same proccing condition. Roar of Battle's +10 Handling and Stability is unspectacular, but is better for this roll than Suros Synergy which procs on a reload (which we're bypassing) to provide +40 Handling and ×1.2 Flinch Resistance for 6s.

At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are decent with a boost at Tier 4/5 when barrel and magazine perks are enhanced - d2foundry.gg calculates that Range of 44 translates to 19.30m hipfire and 32.81m ADS before damage drop-off, 52 Stability is ×1.0800 flinch resistance, 42 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.40s stow speed, 38 Reload Speed is a 2.01s reload and Magazine Size is 33 (max 48). Controller players will probably need a bit of assistance from the barrel perk to control the recoil, but M+KB can focus on boosting handling. As the magazine perk, the combat effect rounds are all here, or look to boost Reload Speed. For a general purpose roll, in the first trait perk column Demolitionist is great for generating grenade ability energy, and also to refill the magazine on grenade usage, or Rapid Hit improves Stability by up to +25 and Reload Speed by up to +60 with a ×0.92 animation modifier at 5 stacks on rapid crit hits. For damage, Frenzy is always decent for a ×1.15 damage boost and maxing out both Handling and Reload Speed while in combat, Binary Orbit provides a ×1.25 boost to damage for 8.5s (10.5s when enhanced) for getting a kill with an opposite energy type - so any light-based energy kill will proc, or Dragonfly procs a 4.5m AoE explosion on a crit kill to help deal with groups of adds. The Exhaustive Research Origin Trait is very good for PvE - ADS for 1s at an enemy up to 60m away, and the next shot will fire a mini-rocket - these are affected by and can proc rocket-based perks and traits too - with a 5s cooldown. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

// Faustus Decline - PvE Minors god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds), (Rimestealer), (Headstone)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 148 from 5 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3S0TObWihybmZdCLM6wIUw?si=cf08fccbb9d44fa7) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE roll for clearing Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with a Stasis build. Faustus isn't a bad sidearm - the Lightweight frame boosts mobility - now the hidden Athletics stat - for better base movement speed and jump height. But at the end of the day it's still a primary sidearm, all of which need a bit of attention, with mainly PvP trait perks. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 25 Range equates to 12.00m hipfire and 14.40m when ADS before damage falloff, 42 Stability is ×1.0550 flinch resist at base, 68 Handling is 0.24s ready, 0.19s ADS and 0.30s stow speed, and 50 Reload Speed is a 1.58s reload. Ammo Generation is 50, Recoil Direction is 95, and Zoom is 12. Bumping up Handling with the barrel perk will make the gunfeel noticibly snappier, but on controller you might want to look at Stability too. For the magazine perk, Alloy Magor Flared Magwell are reliable options for boosting gunfeel stats, or one of the combat effect options adds utility. For Stasis builds, you have the Rimestealer and Headstone combination to build Frost Armor stacks on killing frozen enemies or shattering Stasis crystals, which you can generate on crit kills. The Bray Legacy Origin Trait is solid in PvE, generating around 0.2% energy per hit for whichever ability is closest to a full charge. If you're interested, "Dr Faustus" is an Elizabethan tragedy by Christopher Marlowe, based on German stories about a scholar who sells his soul to the devil in exchange for magical power.

// Fortunate Star - PvE Minors god 1
// (Elastic String, Polymer String, Flexible String), (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), (Repulsor Brace, Dragonfly), (Destabilizing Rounds, Demoralize)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 149 from 12 August 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2bhcY40IAVpSlQ0iaW50v0?si=5e88adac224e4ae9) with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller):  First-choice PvE roll for clearing minor add groups both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly for void builds. Fortunate Star, as a lightweight weapon, boosts the hidden mobility stat by +20 and base movement speed by ×1.0625, but sacrifices damage per shot in comparison to precisions. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are very good - Draw Time is 612, Accuracy is 34 and d2foundry.gg calculates that 58 Stability is a 0.67s perfect draw window and ×1.1188 flinch resistance, 28 Handling is 0.54s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, and 33 Reload Speed is a 0.68s reload. Ammo Generation is 70 and Recoil Direction is 52. For the bowstring perk, Elastic String reduces Draw Time the most, but Polymer String or Flexible String will also work well. With the arrow perk, look for one that boost Accuracy. There's a pretty full set of void trait perks available to synergise with void builds - in the first column, Repulsor Brace gains you an overshield for 8s (10s when Enhanced), which can be extended to 12s (15s when enhanced) with Echo of Persistence, on a void-debuffed enemy kill. Alternatively, Dragonfly creates a 4.5m void AoE explosion on a crit kill. In the second column, Destabilizing Rounds spreads volatility for easy clean-up of add mobs or, in harder content, Demoralize weakens nearby enemies for an effective ×1.176 damage boost - for both, Dragonfly explosions will throw the effect out further. The Veist Stinger Origin Trait is strong for bows, offering a 10% chance per shot to proc for 7s worth of ×0.85 draw time and ×0.9 ADS time. The Dreamwork Origin Trait is also decent in PvE when you're in a fireteam, by reducing Draw Time for a few seconds when killing enemies while teamshooting. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Accuracy, with your preferred choice of mod/enhanced mod to boost weapon stats, ammo regeneration, or elemental pickups for builds - and don't forget to check any available seasonal fragile mods.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Prosecutor is a precision AR, with the frame intrinsic offering a more vertical recoil. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are pretty good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 60 Range equates to 29.20m ADS and 18.25m hipfire before damage falloff, 42 Stability is ×1.1619 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 46 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.30s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, and 45 Reload Speed is a 1.89s reload. Recoil Direction is 69 (but you can ignore that with the frame intrinsic), and Zoom is 16, and Magazine size is 32 (max 44). With it being relatively easy to control you can push out the Range, or improve Handling. In the magazine perk slot, any of the combat effect mags are great or choose something that helps Reload Speed. For an all-round general use roll, in the first trait perk column Attrition Orbs will generate a power orb to proc armor mods after hitting enemies with roughly 2/3 of your magazine, Dragonfly generates a 4.5m Arc AoE explosion on crit kills, or Eddy Current boosts Reload Speed by +20 after sprinting for 1.5s (or +60 instantly when amplified) with a ×0.95 reload and handling animation. In the second column, for damage, Paracausal Affinity provides a ×1.2 boost for 6s following a light energy kill. The Crossing Over origin trait is a little strange, providing extra range and handling in the top half of the mag, and a damage boost in the bottom starting at ×1.015 at 50% and ×1.03 with your penultimate and last shot, while Gravity Well can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are pretty good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 60 Range equates to 29.20m ADS and 18.25m hipfire before damage falloff, 42 Stability is ×1.1619 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 46 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.30s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, and 45 Reload Speed is a 1.89s reload. Recoil Direction is 69 (but you can ignore that with the frame intrinsic), and Zoom is 16, and Magazine size is 32 (max 44). With it being relatively easy to control you can push out the Range, or improve Handling. In the magazine perk slot, any of the combat effect mags are great or choose something that helps Reload Speed. For arc synergy with Bolt Charge, in the first trait perk column Dragonfly generates a 4.5m Arc AoE explosion on crit kills, to soften up groups of adds to make them easier to kill for Rolling Storm to generate stacks of Bolt Charge on kills. The Crossing Over origin trait is a little strange, providing extra range and handling in the top half of the mag, and a damage boost in the bottom starting at ×1.015 at 50% and ×1.03 with your penultimate and last shot, while Gravity Well can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

While adaptives lose out to double burst and precision HCs for pure damage output, Judgment offers the rare choice of sights rather than barrels, if that's your preference. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 44 Range equates to 29.94m ADS and 19.96m hipfire before damage falloff, 42 Stability is ×1.1371 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, and 45 Reload Speed is a 2.65s reload. Recoil Direction is 95, and Zoom is 14, and Magazine size is 9 (max 14). You can use any of the sight perks that don't involve a malus to fill out the stats. In the magazine perk slot, we're looking for something that helps Reload Speed. For grenade builds, if you don't aleady have a decent hand cannon with the Demolitionist + Adrenaline Junkie trait perk combo, to generate grenade ability energy on a kill (and instantly reload on a grenade use) and provide an up to ×1.33 damage boost for 4.5s. The Crossing Over origin trait is a little strange, providing extra range and handling in the top half of the mag, and a damage boost in the bottom starting at ×1.015 at 50% and ×1.03 with your penultimate and last shot, while Gravity Well can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 141 from 27 May 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/51wAzrVIRJRsBHGTMCLZ0n?si=fade7bb615184d3e) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with a Strand build. Relentless returns as a Strand high-impact frame, offering bonus accuracy when ADSing and moving slowly or stationery. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are pretty average - d2foundry.gg calculates that 55 Range equates to 32.20m ADS and 20.13m hipfire before damage falloff, 49 Stability is ×1.1653 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 24 Handling is 0.47s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.46s stow speed, and 36 Reload Speed is a 2.12s reload. Recoil Direction is 65, and Zoom is 18, and Magazine size is 27 (max 45). With the handling and Recoil Direction both needing love, there's really only one barrel perk to choose - Arrowhead Brake. In the magazine perk slot, any of the combat effect mags are great or choose something that helps Reload Speed. For Strand builds, Tear or Slice in the first trait perk column provide an option to proc sever to reduce damage output from enemies to ×0.6 - Tear spreading sever in a AoE cloud on a crit kill, so good for tough groups of adds, or Slice to apply it up to three times on a hit after using your class ability, so better for single targets or bosses. In the second column Paracausal Affinity provides a ×1.2 damage boost for 6s following a darkness energy kill. The Crossing Over origin trait is a little strange, providing extra range and handling in the top half of the mag, and a damage boost in the bottom starting at ×1.015 at 50% and ×1.03 with your penultimate and last shot, while Gravity Well can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

The trait perk combination of Firefly in the first trait perk column, which procs a 4m-wide solar explosion on a crit kill (and buffs Reload Speed by +50 for 6s) and Elemental Honing as as additional damage perk in the second should mean that a crit kill should proc two stacks from the two different energy types for a ×1.1 for 20s.

Nature Reclaimed is a lightweight, so its frame intrinsic grants +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 movement speed. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are pretty decent - d2foundry.gg calculates that 29 Range equates to 69.59m ADS and 34.80m hipfire before damage falloff, 43 Stability is ×1.1517 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 71 Handling is 0.34s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.32s stow speed, and 57 Reload Speed is a 1.87s reload. Recoil Direction is 56 and Zoom is 19. You could probably do with recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is great, or even Chambered Compensator works as an alternate. In the magazine perk slot, choose something that helps Reload Speed. For a solar build, in the first trait perk column, you do have Heal Clip available for ×2 Cure (and ×1 Cure for allies in 15m) on a reload after a kill but, if you're taking damage at scout rifle ranges you might be doing it wrong so Rapid Hit is a nother possibility - at 5 stacks it provides +25 Stability and +60 Reload Speed with a ×0.92 reload animation multiplier. In the second, there's Incandescent for spreading scorch stacks to build towards ignitions to clear add crowds quickly. The Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE to reduce enemy accuracy after you get a kill at low health.

Aggressive frame shotguns maybe aren't the optimum for damage, but A Sudden Death has a couple of trait perk combinations that make it worth considering. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats aren't good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 24 Range equates to 4.48m before damage falloff, 26 Stability is ×1.1067 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 24 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.49s stow speed, and 32 Reload Speed is a 0.86s per shell reload. Recoil Direction is 74, and Zoom is 12, and Magazine size is 4 (max 6). With 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, total ammo is 21/23/25/26 (max 27). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, or close up pellet spread a little. In the magazine perk slot, Assault Mag improves RPM to 60RPM, or Tactical Mag plus Backup Mag increases the mag size to maximum. The unique roll to chase for burst DPS is the double damage trait perk combination of One-Two Punch, for ×2 direct contact melee damage within 1.22s after landing all 12 pellets (10 when enhanced) on target and Trench Barrel for ×1.5 damage (and +30 Handling and Reload Speed) for 5s or three shots. So punch, land three shots, punch, empty the magazine, punch, reload should see the end of most bulky mid-tier enemies.

Aggressive frame shotguns maybe aren't the optimum for damage, but A Sudden Death has a couple of trait perk combinations that make it worth considering. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats aren't good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 24 Range equates to 4.48m before damage falloff, 26 Stability is ×1.1067 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 24 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.49s stow speed, and 32 Reload Speed is a 0.86s per shell reload. Recoil Direction is 74, and Zoom is 12, and Magazine size is 4 (max 6). With 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, total ammo is 21/23/25/26 (max 27). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, or close up pellet spread a little. In the magazine perk slot, Assault Mag improves RPM to 60RPM, or Tactical Mag plus Backup Mag increases the mag size to maximum. For add clearing, and occasional burst damage against bulkier enemies, the trait perk combination of Discord in the first trait perk column for bypassing the small magazine, granting free ammo on a kill for 7s, after a kill with another weapon. Pair that with Destabilizing Rounds, to spread volatility on a kill to quickly clear add crowds, and synergise with Void builds. The Crossing Over origin trait is a little strange, providing extra range and handling in the top half of the mag, and a damage boost in the bottom starting at ×1.015 at 50% and ×1.03 with your penultimate and last shot, while Gravity Well can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

Cruel Mercy is the new Heresy Act 3 Nightfall weapon - the Heavy Burst intrinsic gives you a bit of flinch reduction when ADSing, which is useful if unspectacular. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 76 Range equates to 39.06m ADS and 21.70m hipfire before damage dropoff, 35 Stability is ×1.1337 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 35 Handling is 0.45s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 42 Reload Speed is a 2.01s reload, Recoil Direction is 74, and Zoom is 18. Handling is the main weakness, so look to improve that from the barrel perk to make things snappier. For the magazine perk, either choose your preferred combat effect or look to speed up the reload a bit. For arc builds there's a combination of Eddy Current to speed up reload further, together with Rolling Storm to build up stacks of Bolt Charge for single target damage plus a bit of AoE. But, as an alternative first trait column perk, Dragonfly provides an AoE arc elemental explosion on a crit kill for double damage perks, which are always tough to pass on. For the origin trait you have Vanguard's Vindication for 3HP healing per kill, Stunning Recovery for 60HP and +40 recovery for 3s when stunning a champion, or Omolon Fluid Dynamics for better stability and reload speed in the top half of the magazine for compulsive reloaders.

Liminal Vigil is the only Stasis Heavy Burst sidearm currently in the game - the intrinsic frame perk reduces flinch slightly when you're ADSing. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 58 Range equates to 15.98m ADS and 13.32m hipfire before damage dropoff, 39 Stability is ×1.1427 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 30 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 20 Reload Speed is a 1.91s reload, Recoil Direction is 94, Zoom is 12, and magazine size is 26 (max 40). A little bit of Stability and Handling from the barrel perk are useful to improve gunfeel and control, particularly if you're spamming shots. For the magazine perk, the combat effect magazines all add utility, or look to speed up the reload a bit. For Stasis builds, the combination of Headstone and Rimestealer should generate crystals and shards to proc fragment effects, and apply Frost Armor to help keep you alive while you're in CQC. The Tex Balanced Stock is there if you like hipfiring, but the Gravity Well origin trait can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

The original double-fire grenade launch Wilderflight returns with refreshed perks. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are in-band - d2foundry.gg calculates that 93 Velocity equates to 65.31m/s, 20 Stability is ×1.1000 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 43 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.42s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 32 Reload Speed is a 2.62s reload, Recoil Direction is 25, and Zoom is 13. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, total ammo is 21/22/23/23 (max 23). For barrel perk choices, look for something that improves Handling and Velocity. Then, for controlling enemy crowds - from Minor adds and Elites, through to Minibosses and Champions (but not Bosses), Disorienting Grenades as the magazine perk is still very powerful, particularly with the increased effect radius from the dual grenades. To pair with that, in the first trait perk column, Slideshot is the top pick as, as well as reloading it also procs Gravity Well to collect nearby ammo bricks. Auto-Loading Holster is also available, but its reload effect doesn't work with Gravity Well. You'll need direct hits to damage enemies, as Disorientating Grenades reduces Blast Radius to 0, but Destabilizing Rounds can spread volatility in groups, or Frenzy does boost damage by ×1.15 as well as maxing out Handling and Reload Speed by being in combat.

// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), (Spike Grenades), (Slideshot, Auto-Loading Holster, Envious Arsenal), (Bait and Switch) 
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 139 from 13 May 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0m6Sfdv88fNZmYm9A6PdVR?si=140d643338154357) with @ImpetusAlways @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for damage against Majors and Bosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. The original double-fire grenade launch Wilderflight returns with refreshed perks. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are in-band - d2foundry.gg calculates that 93 Velocity equates to 65.31m/s, 20 Stability is ×1.1000 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 43 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.42s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 32 Reload Speed is a 2.62s reload, Recoil Direction is 25, and Zoom is 13. With 0/1/2/3 reserves, total ammo is 21/22/23/23 (max 23). For barrel perk choices, look for something that improves Handling and Velocity. Then, for the magazine perk for damage against beefier enemies, Spike Grenades increases impact damage by ×1.1212, which is ×1.025 to overall damage. To pair with that, in the first trait perk column, Slideshot is the top pick as, as well as reloading it also procs Gravity Well to collect nearby ammo bricks. Auto-Loading Holster and Envious Arsenal are also very usable, but their reload effects don't work with Gravity Well. For damage, Bait and Switch in the second column boosts damage by ×1.3 for rotating through your weapons and hitting enemies. The Tex Balanced Stock is there if you like hipfiring, but the Gravity Well origin trait can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload, or using Slideshot or Demolitionist (other reload perks don't seem to work, unfortunately). Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Unfortunately, Terminus Horizon is in the weakest subfamily for damage, so you can pass if you already have a well-rolled arc LMG. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 64 Range equates to 47.88m ADS and 29.93m hipfire before damage dropoff, 25 Stability is ×1.1112 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 38 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.38s stow speed, 24 Reload Speed is a 5.44s reload, Recoil Direction is 74, Zoom is 17, and magazine size is 46 (max 73). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 382/427/472/495 (max 495). A little bit of Stability and Handling from the barrel perk are useful to improve gunfeel and control. For the magazine perk, pretty much any is useable, except maybe Extended Mag. You might use this with double special as a heavy pseudo-scout rifle for general add clearing, in which case the double damage perks of Dragonfly for an arc AoE explosion on a crit kill, and Killing Tally for up to ×1.3 damage after three kills for as long as you don't reload or stow.The Tex Balanced Stock is there if you like hipfiring, but the Gravity Well origin trait can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - d2foundry.gg calculates that 64 Range equates to 47.88m ADS and 29.93m hipfire before damage dropoff, 25 Stability is ×1.1112 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 38 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.38s stow speed, 24 Reload Speed is a 5.44s reload, Recoil Direction is 74, Zoom is 17, and magazine size is 46 (max 73). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 382/427/472/495 (max 495). A little bit of Stability and Handling from the barrel perk are useful to improve gunfeel and control. For the magazine perk, the priority is to maximise mag size, although TBH any mag perk can work. For an arc build, you might use this with double special as a heavy pseudo-scout rifle for general add clearing, using Reconstruction or Triple Tap in the first trait perk column to keep topping off the magazine, or Eddy Current to improve Reload Speed together with Rolling Storm to build up Bolt Charge stacks for single target chunk damage with some AoE damage too. The Tex Balanced Stock is there if you like hipfiring, but the Gravity Well origin trait can be very useful to pick up ammo bricks within 5m on a manual reload.

// Admetus-D - PvE Majors god 1
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling), (Armor-Piercing Rounds), (Repulsor Brace), (Withering Gaze) 
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 136 from 1 April 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6I828LxsIqdth4iIlSYRmG?si=8022df8ede664223) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for piercing Barrier Champions in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with void builds. Admetus-D is a rare energy Häkke weapon - a void scout rifle with the High-Impact frame intrinsic of ×0.8 accuracy cone size and ×0.83 accuracy cone growth when you're stationary or moving less than 2.8m/s, for easier crits and hits. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - 65 Range equates to 80.88m ADS and 40.44m hipfire before damage dropoff, 29 Stability is ×1.1202 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 30 Handling is 0.45s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 35 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload, Recoil Direction is 76, Zoom is 21, and magazine size is 14 (max 20). Handling is the stat that needs the most TLC, so that's the top choice for the barrel perks. Then, for a stick-it-in-your-vault for when the artifact mod is around, the combination of Armor-Piercing Rounds for ×1.05 damage to shields and barriers, together with Repulsor Brace for a void overshield for killing void debuffed targets and Withering Gaze to apply 15% weaken for an effective ×1.176 damage boost for 6s for your whole fireteam should make short work of Barrier Champions.

Admetus-D is a rare energy Häkke weapon - a void scout rifle with the High-Impact frame intrinsic of ×0.8 accuracy cone size and ×0.83 accuracy cone growth when you're stationary or moving less than 2.8m/s, for easier crits and hits. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are good - 65 Range equates to 80.88m ADS and 40.44m hipfire before damage dropoff, 29 Stability is ×1.1202 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 30 Handling is 0.45s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 35 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload, Recoil Direction is 76, Zoom is 21, and magazine size is 14 (max 20). Handling and Reload Speed are the stats that needs the most TLC, so that's the top choice for the barrel and magazine perks, although the combat effect rounds are also good choices. If you prefer plinking away at enemies from a distance, you can use the void-friendly combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column, for an overshield when killing void-debuffed enemies, together with Demoralize to spread weaken in an AoE cloud on a crit kill to deal with crowds, or Withering Gaze to apply weaken to a beefier single target by ADSing for 1.5s. Both apply 15% void weaken for an effective ×1.176 damage boost for 6s for your whole fireteam.

If you prefer plinking away at enemies from a distance, you can use the combination of Rapid Hit or Keep Away in the first trait perk column to improve gunfeel without needing a kill. In the second, Frenzy boosts damage by ×1.15 and maxes out Handling and Reload Speed or, use the void-friendly options of Demoralize to spread weaken in an AoE cloud on a crit kill to deal with crowds, or Withering Gaze to apply weaken to a beefier single target by ADSing for 1.5s.

// Cruoris FR4 - PvE Minors god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal) Rifling, (Enhanced Battery, Accelerated Coils), (Discord), (One for All)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 136 from 1 April 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6I828LxsIqdth4iIlSYRmG?si=8022df8ede664223) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing tougher adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with a double special loadout. Cruoris FR4 is a rare Aggressive Frame fusion rifle that shoots three horizontal bursts of four bolts in a widening spread - think of how the Bastion exotic works. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are decent - standard 667ms charge time, 37 Range equates to 21.09m ADS and 16.22m hipfire before damage dropoff, 36 Stability is ×1.11.80 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 34 Handling is 0.45s ready, 0.35s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 31 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload, Recoil Direction is 55, Zoom is 15, and magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 17/20/23/24 (max 25). Handling is the stat that needs the most TLC, so that's the top choice for the barrel perks. As the battery perk, boost the battery size or use Accelerated Coils to reduce charge time. If you're running double special then, after a kill with another weapon, Discord in the first trait perk column gives you 7s of free ammo on a kill as well as reducing both ADS animation and accuracy cone size to ×0.75. Pair that with One For All in the second column for a ×1.3 damage boost for hitting three enemies, and you can cook anything within 15m or so. If you're interested, Cruoris is the genitive singular form of the Latin word for blood or blood clot, "cruor". The Omolon Fluid Dynamics is a useful origin trait, boosting stability and reload speed in the top half of a battery (which should be easy with Discord). Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 136 from 1 April 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6I828LxsIqdth4iIlSYRmG?si=8022df8ede664223) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing Minor adds, Elites, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and end-game underleveled content. Qua Furor V is in a good subfamily for damage so if you don't have a decent stasis LMG, it might be worth a look. At base, by comparison with its peers, the stats are poor - 34 Range equates to 46.81m ADS and 29.26m hipfire before damage dropoff, 48 Stability is ×1.1630 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 42 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.37s stow speed, 40 Reload Speed is a 5.04s reload(!), Recoil Direction is 58, Zoom is 16, and magazine size is 63 (max 91). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 435/489/544/571 (max 571). You'll probably need a bit of help with either Recoil Direction or Stability to help hit crits. Then, looking at the glacial reload time, Reload Speed is the priority but the combat effect magazine perks are also decent. In the first trait perk column, if you're clearing adds, it should be easy to get to five stacks of Feeding Frenzy for maxxed out Reload Speed and a ×0.8 animation multiplier. For damage, One For All provides ×1.35 damage for 10s for hitting three enemies or Dragonfly provides a Stasis AoE explosion on a crit kill. If you're interested, Qua Furor translates from Latin to "as rage" or "in the capacity of rage". The Wild Card origin trait is fun, dropping Telesto-style "experimental submunitions" on kills for additional add-clearing potential. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Stasis shards or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller

Unfortunately, Anamnesis is in the Lightweight subfamily of bows, so although you do get the frame intrinsic +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 movement speed bonus, that's at the cost of accuracy and damage. At base, the stats are in-band - 32 Accuracy, 50 Stability is ×1.1844 flinch resist at 100 Resilience and a perfect draw window of 0.65s, 64 Handling is 0.55s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, 60 Reload Speed is a 0.68s reload, and Recoil Direction is 40. As ever with bows, the usual play is to reduce Draw Time with the bowstring perk and recover any lost accuracy with the arrow perk. For void builds, there are the trait perk combinations of Repulsor Break, for a void overshield on a void-debuffed kill in the first column, together with either Destabilizing Rounds, to spread AoE volatility and proc volatile rounds for 4.5s on kills, or Demoralize to spread AoE weaken for an effective ×1.18 damage boost against enemies. If you're interested, "Anamnesis" is the act of recalling something to mind. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of.

// (Elastic String, Polymer String, Natural String), (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), (Archer's Tempo, Dragonfly), (Sword Logic)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 135 from 25 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JwIN3avdyW27aRjv4Zb2D?si=21b247e788174887) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing groups of Minor adds in general at-level content. Unfortunately, Anamnesis is in the Lightweight subfamily of bows, so although you do get the frame intrinsic +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 movement speed bonus, that's at the cost of accuracy and damage. At base, the stats are in-band - 32 Accuracy, 50 Stability is ×1.1844 flinch resist at 100 Resilience and a perfect draw window of 0.65s, 64 Handling is 0.55s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, 60 Reload Speed is a 0.68s reload, and Recoil Direction is 40. As ever with bows, the usual play is to reduce Draw Time with the bowstring perk and recover any lost accuracy with the arrow perk. In the first trait perk column, fan-favourite Archer's Tempo applies a ×0.75 animation scalar to draw time for 3s after a crit hit, or Dragonfly generates a 4.5m AoE void explosion on crit kills. In the second column, for general content, Sword Logic grants a refreshable ×1.15 damage boost for 5.5s for killing Minor red-bar adds, and ×1.25 for 7.5s for orange-bar elites. The higher stacks (×1.35 for 10.5s for Miniboss kills and ×1.5 for 15.5s for Bosses) are less achievable, but still theoretically possible. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will reduce Draw Time for each Guardian you're within 15m of. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

If you don't already have a well-rolled melee build SMG or are looking for a replacement for an older one without an origin trait, then Mirror Imago could work but, if you do, you can safely give it a pass. At base, the stats are okay - 42 Range and 14 Zoom equates to 18.24m ADS and 13.03m hipfire, 46 Stability is ×1.1731 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 52 Handling is 0.35s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.32s stow speed, 50 Reload Speed is a 1.82s reload, Recoil Direction is 99 and magazine size is 36 (max 41). Use the barrel perk for Handling on M+KB or Stability for controller, although you might also find a little extra range useful, and the magazine perk can be used to provide a bit more reload speed or extra rounds. It's a niche roll, but if you're a Titan running the Exotic Peacekeeper legs, you'll want as large a magazine as possible - Overflow boosts size by ×2 (×2.2 when enhanced) and use Sword Logic's escalating damage boost - you should be able to get to two stacks for ×1.25 damage for 7.5s to combine with the Peacekeepers ×2 damage boost after 20 hits. If you're interested, Mirror Imago is a technique in relationship therapy aimed at fostering a deeper relationship and connection. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of.

On Controller, a little help with controlling recoil is useful, or on M+KB boost handling with the barrel perk, and look for reload speed with the magazine perk. For arc builds, and if you never got the chance to craft a Brigand's Law, the trait perk combination of Eddy Current in the first column can just about max out Reload Speed when you're Amplified, with a ×0.95 animation scalar, which is ideal to use with Voltshot in the second to apply Jolt to targets for chunk damage and AoE arc damage for add clearing.

In addition, in the first column, look for trait perks that either overfill the battery more or help keep it topped up - Ambitious Assassin to overflow up to ×2 depending on the number of rapid kills before reloading, Discord to refund ammo from thin air on kills for 7s after getting a kill with another weapon, or Grave Robber to refill the battery from reserves on an elemental melee hit or melee kill. Alternatively, Lead From Gold helps with ammo economy. Recommended MW: Charge Time or Handling, with an Adept Backup Mag mod (if the battery is already max capacity then Quick Access Sling) or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 135 from 25 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5JwIN3avdyW27aRjv4Zb2D?si=21b247e788174887) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing groups of Minor adds in both end-game underlevelled or general at-level or better content. If you're still looking for a decent void fusion rifle (and one that looks good too), then Afterlight is an option worth considering. At base, the stats are in-band - 31 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 15.58m ADS and 11.98m hipfire, 39 Stability is ×1.1214 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 31 Handling is 0.45s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 39 Reload Speed is a 2.15s reload, Recoil Direction is 52 and magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 21/24/26/28 (max 28). Use the barrel perk to straighten up the Recoil Direction and a little extra handling with the barrel perk. For the battery perk, add extra shots or there's always Liquid Coils and Accelerated Coils to improve damage or charge time. Building into Destabilizing Rounds, to help spread volatility and proc volatile rounds. In addition, in the first column, look for trait perks that either overfill the battery more or help keep it topped up - Ambitious Assassin to overflow up to ×2 depending on the number of rapid kills before reloading, Discord to refund ammo from thin air on kills for 7s after getting a kill with another weapon, or Grave Robber to refill the battery from reserves on an elemental melee hit or melee kill. Alternatively, Lead From Gold helps with ammo economy. Willing Vessel is a useful, if unspectacular origin trait to boost gunfeel stats in the background as you hit and kill targets, but if you're in a fireteam, and manually reloading, Runneth Over will overfill your magazine by an additional 10% (rounded up) for each Guardian you're within 15m of.

Refusal of the Call is the first adaptive frame strand glaive, which is the subfamily with the best shield duration, if that's your play. At base, the stats are okay - 64 Range equates to 18.49m and a velocity of 111.28m/s, 44 Shield Duration is 11.49s, 60 Handling is 0.30s ready and 0.35s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 2.75s reload, and magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 30/36/40/42 (max 42). There are a couple of Haft perks that can help boost shield duration, but they have a mix of bonuses and maluses, so go with that suits your playstyle best. For the magazine perk, either look for something that helps with mag size or reload. There are a few decent trait perks in the first column to help with reload or to avoid reloading altogether - Auto-Loading Holster, Envious Assassin, Impulse Amplifier and Discord. In the second column, pair that together with Close to Melee to boost the glaive melee damage by ×1.3 for 10s on a projectile hit (refreshable for 5s on melee or projectile hits), or Disruption Break which provides a ×1.5 boost to glaive melee damage for 5.5s if you break an enemy's shield with a projectile.

Exalted Truth returns with a perk refresh and provides quite a convincing argument for popping into Trials to get some useful PvE rolls. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 50 Range and 14 Zoom equate to 30.75m ADS and 20.50m hipfire, 58 Stability is ×1.1641 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.61s reload, Recoil Direction is 95, and base magazine size is 11 (max 14).

The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health, or if you're soloing content, Alacrity provides excellent gunfeel boosts: +20 to Range and Stability, +50 to Reload Speed and +10 to Aim Assist.

Joxer's Longsword is only the second non-endgame Heavy Burst frame pulse rifle - it's a Crucible weapon so if you're focussing with Shaxx reset your reputation as many times as you can to get as many options as possible in the two trait perk columns. At base, the stats are on the low side by comparison with its end-game peers, but in-band when compared to Corrasion - 74 Range and 18 Zoom equate to 38.79m ADS and 21.55m hipfire, 33 Stability is ×1.1292 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 36 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.39s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 2.18s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. Base magazine size is 30. Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, and then any of the combat effect magazine perks or something to help with the slow reload speed. For void build synergy, you have access to Repulsor Brace in the first trait perk column, for a Void Overshield for 8s when killing an enemy affected by a void debuff. To match with that, for dealing with add crowds, Destabilizing Rounds spreads volatility and procs volatile rounds, or Demoralize spreads Weaken on a crit kill, effectively boosting damage to nearby enemies by ×1.18. Of the three origin traits, One Quiet Moment is probably the most useful for PvE, boosting Handling by +20 and Reload Speed by +40 with a ×0.95 animation duration after 5s of not dealing or receiving damage, or and 1.5s after you get a kill but if you're trying to hit crits, Nadir Focus boosts range by up to +10 and up to ×1.075 increased accuracy cone size as you fire.

At base, the stats are top-tier by comparison with its peer - 54 Range and 20 Zoom equates to 34.09m ADS and 20.05m hipfire, 63 Stability is ×1.1967 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 74 Handling is 0.31s ready, 0.31s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 65 Reload Speed is a 1.65s reload and Recoil Direction is 65. The stats are pretty balanced, so you can boost Range, Stability, Handling and/or Reload Speed with the barrel and magazine perks, to your preference. For stasis builds, the trait perk combination of Rimestealer and Headstone generates Frost Armor stacks from freezing enemies and shattering the Stasis crystals for AoE damage from Headstone. There's no origin trait, but you have a choice of Stock perks instead - any of them work, depending on what you drop in the barrel and mag slots.

To pair with theat in the second, Desperate Measures boosts damage by up to ×1.3 for 7s by combining weapon and ability kills, Sword Logic is pretty easy to keep a stack or two of damage bonus by killing increasingly tanky enemies (although getting to the fourth stack of ×1.5 damage after killing a boss is difficult to pull off and maybe of limited use if that's the end of an encounter), or Headstone provides AoE damage when you break the Stasis crystal after a crit kill. There's no origin trait, but you have a choice of Stock perks instead - any of them work, depending on what you drop in the barrel and mag slots. If you're interested, an Estoc is a thrusting sword, from the Renaissance. Recommended MW: personal preference, as any will work, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Stasis shards or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

Peacebond's trait perk pool is more PvP oriented, but there are still a few useful PvE rolls for sidearm aficionados. At base, the stats are in-band by comparison with its peers - 33 Range and 12 Zoom equate to 14.78m ADS and 12.32m hipfire, 79 Stability is ×1.2327 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 50 Handling is 0.29s ready, 0.23s ADS and 0.33s stow speed, 29 Reload Speed is a 1.81s reload and Recoil Direction is 92. Sidearm range is very compressed, so maybe look to improve Stability (Controller) or Handling (M+KB) with the barrel and magazine perks. For stasis builds, the trait perk combination of Headstone and Rimestealer generates Frost Armor stacks from freezing enemies and shattering the Stasis crystals for AoE damage from Headstone. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health. Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Reload Speed with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Stasis shards or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

Resounding is only the second version of the Aggressive Frame fusion rifle subfamily, and the first in the kinetic slot, firing three horizontal bursts of four bolts in a gradually widening spread. At base, the stats are in-band by comparison with its peers - 35 Range and 15 Zoom equate to 21.35m ADS and 16.43m hipfire, 57 Stability is ×1.1416 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 28 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 32 Reload Speed is a 2.26s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. Base battery size is 6 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 20/23/26/28 (max 28). Barrel and magazine perks are fixed - Smallbore and Particle Repeater providing a smidge more Range and Stability. The most useful trait combination is Subsistence, with kills refilling the magazine, to maintain Reservoir Burst's ×1.25 damage boost and AoE explosion on a kill when the battery is full (or nrealy full when enhanced). Of the three origin traits, One Quiet Moment is probably the most useful for PvE, boosting Handling by +20 and Reload Speed by +40 with a ×0.95 animation duration after 5s of not dealing or receiving damage, or and 1.5s after you get a kill. Recommended MW: Reload Speed with a Quick Access Sling mod (Backup Mag tanks your reserves, so avoid) or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Strand Tangles or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

Backfang is the first Rapid-Fire glaive that you can use in the kinetic slot, for any glaive aficionados but, if you're after a roll. remember to reset your Gambit reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 43 Range and equates to 17.35 ADS and a velocity of 100.36m/s, Shield Duration of 27 is 9.62s when fully charged, 71 Handling is 0.27s ready and 0.31s stow speed, 70 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload (1.82s when reloading form an empty mag with the frame intrinsic), and base magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 36/40/44/44 (max 44). The one stat that's noticably poor is Range, so use the barrel perk to improve that, or you can extend Shield Duration if you playstyle involves blocking damage. For the magazine perk, again look to boost Range and/or Reload Speed. There are a fair few potential first trait perk column options for PvE - for a glaive melee playstyle, the combination of Grave Robber to refill your magazine on a melee or elemental ability melee hit, with Close to Melee for a ×1.3 melee damage boost for 10s after a projectile kill is a natual pairing or, alternatively in the first trait perk column, Field Prep boosts ammo reserves as well as Reload Speed and ready/stow speed when crouched, Lead From Gold is great for overall ammo economy, or Impulse Amplifier passively boosts Velocity and Reload Speed. Gun and Run is a decent origin trait for a melee playstyle, granting a ×1.0625 sprint speed boost for 10s for killing a Major or better or three Minors within 10s. Recommended MW: Range with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy for Strand Tangles or when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader.

Lotus-Eater finishes the family of rocket sidearms, providing a void version for the energy slot. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 34 Velocity and 18 Zoom equates to 13.20m ADS and 11.00m hipfire (although damage drop-off is quite shallow), 47 Stability is ×1.1607 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 47 Handling is 0.30s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 55 Reload Speed is a 1.53s reload, Recoil Direction is 89, and base magazine size is 11 (max 18). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 40/43/47/49 (max 55). The one stat that's noticably poor is Velocity, so use the barrel perk to improve that, with either Tactical Mag for a few useful stat bumps or High-Veloity Rounds to further boost Velocity as the magazine perk. For void builds, the fan favourite combination of Repulsor Brace in the firt trait perk column and Destabilizing Rounds in the second provides Void Overshields on void-debuffed kills which you'll get easily with Destabilizing rounds spreading Volatility and proccing Volatile Rounds to clear add groups. Vanguard's Vindication is a better-then-nothing origin trait, returning 10HP on a kill. If there's a champion mod, then Stunning Recovery is great to trigger health regeneration on a champion.

First thing to say is that Keen Thistle, while a decent sniper rifle, is an aggressive frame and so not currently a meta pick for DPS. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 77 Range and 35 Zoom (so a much more open sight than usual), 31 Stability is ×1.1124 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 31 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.37s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 3.15s reload, Recoil Direction is 75, and base magazine size is 3 (max 5). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 24/26/27/27 (max 27). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, and then the magazine perk to increase magazine size to the max of 5 with Backup Mag. If you do want to keep a roll for boss damage, in case of a future buff, then the combination of Envious Arsenal (when enhanced, that counts as a extra reserve mod too) and Bait and Switch, as part of a weapon rotation, refills all your weapons and boosts damage by ×1.3 for 10s (11s with enhanced B+S), or Vorpal Weapon for an always-on ×1.15 damage against Majors and Bosses.

Use the barrel perk to improve Handling (M+KB) or Stability (Controller), and then either a battery perk to boost capacity or Stability or something to help with reload speed. In the first trait perk column, Rewind Rounds is probably the pick of the utility perks, although Envious Assassin or Loose Change are very decent alternatives. In the second column, Detonator Beam is very strong, providing a wide AoE detonation that's like a heavy weapon Chain Reaction on steroids, and about twice the damage Firefly and Dragonfly for landing about 25 shots (around 20 when enhanced), to wipe out groups of adds around your target. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health. Recommended MW: Handling with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

It's been a few seasons since the last new adaptive frame rocket launcher, but Cynosure brings that wait to an end. If you're after a roll, remember to reset your Vanguard reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 54 Velocity equates to 36.02m/s, 44 Stability is ×1.1270 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 41 Handling is 0.50s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.41s stow speed, and 39 Reload Speed is a 3.27s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 8/9/10/11 (max 11). You can boost Handling and/or Velocity with the barrel and magazine perks, or use Impact Casing to boost overall damage by ×1.022. I you don't have a rocket launcher roll for boss damage then in the first trait perk column, Overflow or Reconstruction both overflow the magazine to front-load a damage phase, or Field Prep provides the equivalent of a reserve mod (2 when enhanced) and boosts Reload Speed and ready/stow speed. In the second column, Explosive Light provides an easy ×1.25 damage boost for six shots (7 when enhanced) for just picking up power orbs. If you're interested, "Cynosure" could be something or someone at the centre of attention, someone who directs or guides, or the Ursa Major constellation - take your pick! Suros Synergy is the more useful origin trait, providing +40 Handling and ×1.2 flinch resistance for 6s after a reload. Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.5.2.1 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec M+KB Controller): Backup PvE pick for dealing with Majors in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content. Backfang is the first Rapid-Fire glaive that you can use in the kinetic slot, for any glaive aficionados but, if you're after a roll. remember to reset your Gambit reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 43 Range and equates to 17.35 ADS and a velocity of 100.36m/s, Shield Duration of 27 is 9.62s when fully charged, 71 Handling is 0.27s ready and 0.31s stow speed, 70 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload (1.82s when reloading form an empty mag with the frame intrinsic), and base magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 36/40/44/44 (max 44). The one stat that's noticably poor is Range, so use the barrel perk to improve that, or you can extend Shield Duration if you playstyle involves blocking damage. For the magazine perk, again look to boost Range and/or Reload Speed. There are a fair few potential first trait perk column options for PvE - if you're using the glaive shield regularly, the combination of Replenishing Aegis to refill your mag when blocking damage, or Immovable Object for increased energy when you're stationery and blocking, together with Unstoppable Force for a ×1.2 boost to bolt damage while shielding is a natural pairing. Alternatively, in the first trait perk column, Field Prep boosts ammo reserves as well as Reload Speed and ready/stow speed when crouched, Lead From Gold is great for overall ammo economy, or Impulse Amplifier passively boosts Velocity and Reload Speed. Gun and Run is a decent origin trait for a melee playstyle, granting a ×1.0625 sprint speed boost for 10s for killing a Major or better or three Minors within 10s. Recommended MW: Range with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy for Strand Tangles or when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 25/27/28/29 (max 31). Use the barrel perk to bump up the Blast Radius, to widen the wave or, if you're swapping a lot look to boost Handling. For a boss roll against Bosses with multiple bodies, such as Raneiks Unified from the Vesper's Host dungeon, Field Prep provides a reserves mod worth of total ammo (2 when enhanced), and +50 Reload Speed (+55 when enhanced) and ×0.8 reload and handling animations when crouched. Alternatively, Envious Assassin can overload your magazine by as much as ×3, or you can bypass reload with Envious Arsenal. As the damage perk, One For All boosts damage by ×1.35 for 10s for hitting three enemies which is S-Tier for Raneiks' damage phase. Classy Contender is an unspectacular origin trait, generating roughly 5% class ability energy on kills. Recommended MW: Blast Radius or Handling with a Backup Mag mod.

// Watchful Eye (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Ah that new aggressive frame we just got. Another fine addition. Watchful Eye has some standout traits that Pro Memoria didn't. The first being Overflow and Field Prep both allowing better ammo usage. Reconstruction is fine but slow. Then you've got Arc verbiage through Rolling Storm and Jolting Feedback. Both of which depend on whether you like Bolt Charges or Jolt. Neither is the wrong choice. But if you like any other subclass you should look for Killing Tally."

// Vision of Confluence - PvE Minors god 1
// Fluted Barrel, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Incandescent, (Paracausal Affinity, Frenzy, Explosive Payload, Firefly)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Unfortunately, while Vision of Confluence is a solid scout rifle, it's in the subfamily with the lowest damage output and there are other options which offer much the same set of perks. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 46 Range and 20 Zoom equates to 74.93m ADS and 37.46m hipfire, 42 Stability is ×1.1495 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.04s reload and Recoil Direction is 75 (but with the Precision frame intrinsic, you can pretty much ignore the RD stat). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help out a little with Reload Speed and Stability. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - this is the only primary that can roll with Incandescent, with kills spreading scorch and AoE damage.

// Vision of Confluence (Timelost) - PvE Minors god 1
// Fluted Barrel, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Incandescent, (Paracausal Affinity, Frenzy, Explosive Payload, Firefly)
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Unfortunately, while Vision of Confluence is a solid scout rifle, it's in the subfamily with the lowest damage output and there are other options which offer much the same set of perks. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 46 Range and 20 Zoom equates to 74.93m ADS and 37.46m hipfire, 42 Stability is ×1.1495 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.04s reload and Recoil Direction is 75 (but with the Precision frame intrinsic, you can pretty much ignore the RD stat). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help out a little with Reload Speed and Stability. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - this is the only primary that can roll with Incandescent, with kills spreading scorch and AoE damage.

The combination of trait perks and the Timelost Magazine origin trait make Praedyth's Revenge a serious option for a boss special weapon when using a heavy that does damage over time. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 34 Range and 49 Zoom, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.65s reload (2.12s with the Rapid-Fire frame intrinsic when reloading from an empty magazine) and Recoil Direction is 55. Base magazine size is 6 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 30/32/35/35 (max 35). You'll need to keep hitting crits, so use the barrel perk to improve the Recoil Direction, or add Stability. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 shots to make the most of the origin trait, or look to just increase Stability or Reload Speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag. Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column gives you the option for double damage perks and AoE damage (after 3 hits, or 2 when enhanced), but remember it can only proc on a target once, so it only makes sense for one Guardian in a fireteam to be using it. The second column offers a traditional Bait and Switch for ×1.3 damage for rotating through your weapons or Elemantal Honing for up to ×1.4 damage if you can cycle through five different elemental damage types - both of these multipliers also affect Kinetic tremors damage too. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod in you aren't at 7 shots in the mag or Quick Access Sling if you are, or when fully enhanced possibly an Anti-Flinch or Tactical Mod.

Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. Base magazine size is 59 (maximum 91), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 405/451/496/498 (max 601. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For sustained boss damage, the first trait perk column sensible choice is Rewind Rounds - there's every chance you'll get to the end of a damage phase and never have to reload. In the second column, for damage, Killing Tally lets you hold an up to ×1.3 damage boost until reload or stow, or One for All give you a  ×1.35 boost for 10s if there are adds around to help regularly re-proc. As a utility perk option, Withering Gaze applies Weaken for 10s to boost your whole fireteam's damage by an effective ×1.15 just for ADSing for 1.5s.

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - PvE Bosses god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake), (Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Tactical Mag), Rewind Rounds, (Killing Tally, One For All, Withering Gaze)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. Base magazine size is 59 (maximum 91), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 405/451/496/498 (max 601). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For sustained boss damage, the first trait perk column sensible choice is Rewind Rounds - there's every chance you'll get to the end of a damage phase and never have to reload. In the second column, for damage, Killing Tally lets you hold an up to ×1.3 damage boost until reload or stow, or One for All give you a  ×1.35 boost for 10s if there are adds around to help regularly re-proc. As a utility perk option, Withering Gaze applies Weaken for 10s to boost your whole fireteam's damage by an effective ×1.15 just for ADSing for 1.5s. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases.

Fan favourite Fatebringer is still worth a look if you're looking for a strong kinetic slot primary which by default as a kinetic weapon, does ×1.1 damage against Minor adds.

// Unvoiced - PvE Majors god 1 AB

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.2.0.2: PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. This Unvoiced roll looks like it could be an interesting choice for dealing with Champions and Minibosses that you encounter. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 70 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 9.40m ADS and 7.83m hipfire, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 75 Handling is 0.29s ready, 0.28s ADS and 0.32s stow speed, 49 Reload Speed is a 0.71s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 55 (but you can ignore that with the precision frame intrinsic perk. Base mag size is 6 (max 8), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 19/21/23/24 (max 24). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling while for the magazine perk, Assault Mag is the top choice to improve fire rate for better DPS, or add a shot or two to the mag. With the rework of Redirection, in the first trait column, this now lets you build stacks up to 30, 3 at at time for Minor add kills, and use them 3 at a time for ×1.33 damage (2 at a time for ×1.5 when enhanced) against Majors and Bosses - so think of it as a way to bank extra burst damage against against orange and yellow bar enemies enemies by killing adds. In the second column, Frenzy is active anyway when in combat, boosting damage by ×1.15 and maximising Handling and Reload Speed but then, when you face a tougher enemy, both perks combine to provide ×1.53 damage (×1.73 when enhanced) for bursting down Elites, Champions and Minibosses. The Subjugator origin trait is, frankly, nuts - against Minors and Majors it's an extra explosive rounds-style damage boosting perk that also adds flinch on every fourth shot that hits, while against Bosses it procs Exhaustion to reduce their outgoing damage by ×0.9.

Unloved is probably the best-in-kinetic-slot hand cannon as at the time of writing - not only is it the best DPS subfamily, being a heavy-burst frame, but the Subjugation origin trait is essentially a free extra damage perk. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 65 Range and 14 Zoom equates to 32.78m ADS and 21.85m hipfire, 25 Stability is ×1.1084 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 25 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 30 Reload Speed is a 2.94s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help with Reload Speed or perhaps gain a few extra bullets. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - either Dragonfly for a Stasis AoE detonation on crit kills, or Hatchling to spawn a Threadling on crit kills or three rapid kills. In the second column, Frenzy provides ×1.15 damage, and maxes out Handling and Reload Speed just for being in combat or, Paracausal Affinity offers a ×1.2 damage boost for 6s for a Strand or Stasis final blow from any source. The Subjugator origin trait is, frankly, nuts - against Minors and Majors it's an extra explosive rounds-style damage boosting perk that also adds flinch, while against Bosses it procs Exhaustion to reduce their outgoing damage by ×0.9.

Unsworn is, at the time of writing, easily the best-in-kinetic-slot trace rifle for clearing mobs of adds. At base, the stats are in-band by comparison with its peers - 75 Range and 16 Zoom equates to 35.81m ADS and 22.38m hipfire, 25 Stability is ×1.2406 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 50 Reload Speed is a 2.00s reload and Recoil Direction is 97. Base mag size is 98 (max 1.4), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 512/563/614/640 (max 679). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling or for Controller maybe Stability, and the battery perk can be used to help with Reload Speed or perhaps gain a few extra shots. The first trait perk column standout perk is Shoot to Loot - not only allowing safe remote pickup of ammo bricks and power orbs, but reloading all your weapons too, but Rewind Rounds is a decent alternative to extend your magazine and reduce the need to reload too. In the second column, Detonator Beam is very strong, providing a wide AoE detonation that's like a heavy weapon Chain Reaction on steroids, and about twice the damage Firefly and Dragonfly for landing about 25 shots (around 20 when enhanced), to wipe out groups of adds around your target. The Subjugator origin trait is, frankly, nuts - against Minors and Majors it's an extra explosive rounds-style damage boosting perk that also adds flinch on every fourth shot that hits, while against Bosses it procs Exhaustion to reduce their outgoing damage by ×0.9. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Strand Tangles or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 25 February 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0ylHiOQP4ev7qlUTWnXzvD?si=gEk_UXaITayODh1wH2j0SA) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor adds both in general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Unsworn is, at the time of writing, easily the best-in-kinetic-slot trace rifle for clearing adds. At base, the stats are in-band by comparison with its peers - 75 Range and 16 Zoom equates to 35.81m ADS and 22.38m hipfire, 25 Stability is ×1.2406 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 50 Reload Speed is a 2.00s reload and Recoil Direction is 97. Base mag size is 98 (max 1.4), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 512/563/614/640 (max 679). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling or for Controller maybe Stability, and the battery perk can be used to help with Reload Speed or perhaps gain a few extra shots. The first trait perk column standout perk is Shoot to Loot - not only allowing safe remote pickup of ammo bricks and power orbs, but reloading all your weapons too, but Rewind Rounds or Subsistence are decent alternatives to extend your magazine and reduce the need to reload too. In the second column, Killing Tally boosts damage by ×1.3 after three kills until you reload (which StL or Wewindwounds help you avoid) or stow and, when enhanced provides +10 to your magazine stat (equivalent to Tactical Mag). The Subjugator origin trait is, frankly, nuts - against Minors and Majors it's an extra explosive rounds-style damage boosting perk that also adds flinch on every fourth "shot" that hits, while against Bosses it procs Exhaustion to reduce their outgoing damage by ×0.9. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Strand Tangles or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

Adamantite is the second support-frame AR in game, and the first equippable in the kinetic slot, which both heals allies, improves their damage and spawns unravelling projectiles, making it a good, fun weapon to use. At base, the stats are a bit low - 39 Range equates to 25.00m ADS and 15.63m hipfire, 49 Stability is ×1.1816 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.30s stow speed, 66 Reload Speed is a 1.58s reload and Recoil Direction is 52. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Recoil Direction or Stability on controller and handling on M+KB, and the magazine perk can be used to provide a bit more reload speed or extra rounds. The first trait perk column is strong for PvE, but the standout for endgame use is Reciprocity which provides you with healing without having to kill an enemy - 3HP for each hipfired bullet that connects with an ally to heal them. In the second column, pairing this with Circle of Life, for ×1.25 damage for 10s after rapidly healing an ally, Attrition Orbs to power armor mods or Frenzy for maxed Handling and Reload Speed stats and ×1.15 when in combat are all excellent choices. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, overflowing your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading.

Abyssal Edge is only the second wave sword frame (and the only non-raid option), generating a wave frame on a heavy attack costing 4 ammo, followed up by a homing light attack costing 1. At base, the stats are identical - at the time of writing, D2Foundry isn't showing the in-game stats, but hopefully they'll be added in soon. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total base ammo is 67/71/73/74 (max 77). With a burst damage roll, you'll want as much Impact as possible - look for Jagged Edge as the top choice blade perk, with Honed Edge and Tempered Edge as alternates. for the Guard Perk, Swordmaster's Guard improves Charge Rate for heavy attacks, although if you do guard to reduce incoming damage, Balanced Guard is worth a look. In the first trait perk slot, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo for three hits within 2s for better ammo economy, while in the second, the reworked Redirection trait perk lets you build up to 30 stacks by killing 15 Minor adds and use this for ×1.33 damage for 10 hits (using 3 stacks per hit.against Elite or higher enemies. Alternatively, if you're in a crowd, Surrounded passively boosts damage by ×1.4 (×1.47 when enhanced).

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.2.0.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing Minor add crowds in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly wit arc builds. Psychopomp adds an S-Tier arc option to the lineup of area denial frame grenade launchers. At base, the stats are in-band - at the time of writing, D2Foundry isn't showing the in-game stats, but hopefully they'll be added in soon. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 24/25/25/25 (max 25). Quick Launch as the barrel perk boosts both Handling and Velocity, and the High-Velocity Rounds magazine perk adds more Velocity with Reload Speed. In the first trait perk column, Ambitious Assassin overflows the magazine for two shots from a reload after a kill, as can the Runneth Over origin trait when you're with 15m of at least one other ally and, when the stars align, they can both proc for a physics-defying three in the tube. Alternatively, for melee builds, you gain 20% ability energy per kill from Pugilist. In the second column, for arc build synergy, Rolling Thunder speeds up accumulation of Bolt Charge, adding a stack on a kill (2 when Amplified) for additional damage from lightning bolts. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, overflowing your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading.

Chroma Rush has a more PvP-oriented trait perk pool, but the origin trait the boosts handling and reload makes it viable, if you're still looking for a kinetic slot rapid fire auto-rifle. At base, the stats are decent - 25 Range equates to 22.20m ADS and 13.88m hipfire, 56 stability, 35 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, and 47 Reload Speed is a 1.86s reload (1.49s with the intrinsic rapid-fire frame boost if you reload from an empty mag). The recoil direction is mostly vertical, if loose - you can improve control with the barrel perk or, if you're comfortable maybe push out the range a little. In the magazine, on controller, a bit more Stability is nice, boost reload speed further or add some extra bullets. For the trait perk slots, Subsistence is the best for PvE in the first column, while in the second Kinetic Tremors (although the damage scaling isn't great for the AoE shockwave), or Frenzy for a ×1.15 damage boost and max Handling and Reload Speed both work. The Splicer Surge origin trait is nice for PvE - reload after dealing damage for up to three stacks, which boosts handling and reload speed by 10/20/45 and applies a reload animation multiplier of ×0.967/×0.934/×0.9.

If you're still looking for a kinetic burst damage grenade launcher Ignition Code could happily fill that gap. As a lightweight frame, you get the usual +20 mobility and ×1.0625 boost to speed. At base, the stats are decent - 72 Velocity equates to 57.25m/s, 64 Handling is 0.38s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, and 64 Reload Speed is a 2.15s reload. With 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods, total ammo count is 24/25/25/25 (max 25). To maximise damage per shot, Hard Launch and Implosion Rounds in the barrel and magazine perk slots combine for ×1.225 damage and +25 Velocity, or you can forgo damage for a bit of extra handling with the barrel perk, and Spike Grenades are almost as good for damage. In the first trait perk slot, Slideshot provides a way to bypass reload, Lead From Gold keeps ammo topped off or Ambitious Assassin overflows the magazine on a kill and manual reload. For damage you have a choice of Frenzy, High Ground or Vorpal Weapon.

With 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods, total ammo count is 24/25/25/25. For use for disorienting crowds of adds, look for handling and velocity with the barrel perk, as Disorienting Grenades in the magazine perk slot will set the Blast Radius to 0 regardless. In the first trait perk slot, Slideshot provides a way to bypass reload, or Lead from Gold helps with your ammo economy, and Frenzy does provide a ×1.15 damage boost, but mostly maxes out Handling, and Reload Speed too for when you're manually reloading.

Sojourner's Tale reprise has seen it a little neutered, losing trait perks that make a good burst damage weapon but it still has a niche role in clearing more difficult adds. At base, the stats are below average - 61 Range equates to 9.08m ADS and 7.57m hipfire, 40 Stability, 63 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.30s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, and 44 Reload Speed is a 0.75s reload per shell. Magazine size is 6 (max 8), and with 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods you have total ammo of 19/21/23/23 (max 24). If you are in a market for a slug shotgun for burst damage, there is a niche roll that you might consider. Boost Handing with the barrel perk, and then in the magazine perk, Assault Mag improves fire rate, or Tactical Mag (with Backup Mag) maximises magazine size. If you're able to get a kill with another weapon before you start and proc Discord, you'll not need to worry too much about ammo reserves with every kill for 7s, either directly or via Incandescent's scorch and ignition (which you can improve with solar buildcrafting), generating ammo. The Splicer Surge origin trait is nice for PvE - reload after dealing damage for up to three stacks, which boosts handling and reload speed by 10/20/45 and applies a reload animation multiplier of ×0.967/×0.934/×0.9.

// Slayer's Fang (first-choice PvE)
// Arrowhead Brake, Assault Mag, Heart Piercer, Short-Action Stock, Repulsor Brace Retrofit
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 127 from 21 January 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/27QaoJnY0M7c7Ikhz8CbUv?si=397188c406294fcf) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller) Another void exotic special weapon to add to a towering pile, Slayer's Fang might well find a place in a loadout. It's a slug shotty that, after your first kill, grants Nightsworn Sight for 7s - further kills grant 3s of Truesight and create subminitions that weaken enemies on hit. It intrinisically disrupts Overload chmapions, so won't be affected by seasonal shotgun mods or subclass verb effects. Boost the handling by +10 with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag decreases time between shots by ×0.9 in the magazine perk slot. Short-Action Stock as the grip perk increases Handling by +15 and, of the catalyst options, Repulsor Brace Retrofit fits in with the playstyle best, as you'll be close into enemies and probably in need of the overshield from killing weakened enemies. Maybe a bit unusual to use a slug shoutgun for crowd controlling adds, but this should chew through even bulky crowds efficiently.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Red Tape is, surprisingly the first Lightweight frame stasis scout rifle - one of the stronger scout subfamilies for damage output in PvE, and offering the usual +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 boost to movement speed. At base, the stats are decent - the spread of stats among its peers is pretty compressed, though - 32 Range equates to 70.52m ADS and 35.27m hipfire, 33 Stability, 64 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30 ADS and 0.34 stow speed, and 52 Reload speed is a 1.96s reload. Look to boost Handling on M+KB, or improve control for controller with the barrel perk. In the mag, with the origin trait to bypass reload you could just go all-out for magazine size, or maybe look for additional reload speed for manual reloads in the mag perk slot. For Stasis builds, it's not the first scout rifle to offer the trait perk combination of Rimestealer, for Frost Armor stacks from breaking crystals generated by Headstone crit kills, but it's probably the best legendary that does. The Dark Ether Reaper origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation, which also overflows equipped and stowed Dark Ether weapons to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload.

Scavenger's Fate's precision frame means more predictably vertical recoil - not much of an advantage for a shotgun though. At base, the stats are decent - 60 Range equates to 5.53m, 38 Stability, 37 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.36 ADS and 0.45 stow speed, and 46 Reload speed is a 0.73s per shell reload. The magazine size is 5 at base (max 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo count is 20/22/23/24 (max 24). First, look to boost Handling with the barrel perk. In the mag perk slot, Assault Mag increase the RPM by +5 - you can proc the origin trait to bypass reload, when needed. In the first trait column, Discord might be more thought of as a PvP perk, but the infinite ammo on kills for 7s after a kill with another weapon, plus Destabilizing Rounds in the second to spread volatility, should make for a useful way for clearing dense add crowds.

First thing to say is, if you already have a good DPS rocket launcher you can pass, even though aggressive frame rocket launchers are in the highest damage-per-shot category, as the ammo reserves are very low. At base, the other stats are decent - 68 Velocity equates to 37.84m/s, 20 Handling is 0.58s ready, 0.49 ADS and 0.48 stow speed, and 54 Reload Speed is a 3.03s per reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo count is 8/9/10/10 (max 11). If you do want to save a roll, standard practice is to boosts Velocity and/or handling with the barrel perk, and use Impact Casing as the magazine perk to boost damage a bit by ×1.022. In the first trait perk slot, Field Prep helps with reload when crouched, and maxes our total ammo at 11 with two reserves mods (only one when enhanced), or Auto-Loading Holster to reload in the background. In the second, Explosive Light boosts damage by ×1.25 for up to 6 shots (7 when enhanced). The Dark Ether Reaper origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE, although less useful for boss DPS weapons. It generates a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows equipped and stowed Dark Ether weapons to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload. So if you have a second Dark Ether weapon, that does mean that you can start a damage phase with 2 rockets loaded.

Stay Frosty has lost some solid PvE trait perks in its reprise so there's not as much to grind for in 2024-25. At base the stats are a little sub-par - 38 Range equates to 32.05m when ADS and 18.85m hipfire, 67 Handling is a 0.33s ready, 0.33s ADS and 0.31s stow time, and 56Reload Speed is a 1.78s reload. The Lightweight frame provides +20 to mobility and ×1.0625 movement speed. On M+KB you should push out range a bit with the barrel perk and then you can touch on reload or push the range out further with the magazine perk. The trait perk combination of Rimestealer and Headstone is a natural pairing, particularly when synergising with Stasis fragments, generating crystals to use and shatter, to grant a stack of Frost Armor (2 stacks when enhanced). The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration.

At base - 50 Range equates to 47.38m when ADS and 29.61m hipfire, 40 Handling is a 0.40s ready 0.41s ADS time and 0.37s stow time, and 55 Reload Speed is a 4.71s reload. Magazine size is 57 (max 8) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 361/406/451/473 (max 477) - this has been buffed to match other adaptives, making Avalanche very viable as an LMG option. Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk. Then, Appended Mag or Extended Mag work as mag perks, giving you more shots without reloading. To use as a heavy scout rifle for add-clearing, in the first trait perk column the rounds that Rewind Rounds or Subsistence refills save time on reloads, or Dragonfly is always fun for additional solar detinations on crit kills, while Incandescent helps spread scorch stacks and tie into solar subclass fragments to assist with add-clearing. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration.

Zephyr isn't quite as unique as it was when it appeared as the first stasis sword but it's still a useful addition to a vault for CQC boss encounters. All swords have pretty much the same base stats - except Bequest with its 70 Impact - so this stacks up decently by comparison. With 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 67/71/73/74 (max 77). Choose a blade perk that boosts ammo reserves, and then the usual play is Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk to speed up heavy attack regeneration time for maximum damage. For clearing adds, and synergise with stasis builds, the combination of Rimestealer to build up Frost Armor stacks from kills and Cold Steel to apply slow stacks should make the job quick and easy. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is pretty potent for PvE (although it won't proc much during boss damage) - 6 Minor add rapid kills drops a "gift" for your fireteam which on pickup grants +20% energy to all your abilities, restores 22HP and starts health regeneration.

Accrued Redemption's trait perk pool is mostly PvP-oriented, but there's still an excellent roll to shape for use against Champions. At base the stats are solid - Draw Time is standard 0.684ms, 43 Stability equates to a Perfect Draw time of 0.43s, 55 Handling is a 0.58s ready, 0.43s ADS and 0.44s stow time, and 40 Reload Speed is a 0.73s reload. There's no reason to look far beyond the standard Elastic String as the bowstring perk and Straight Fletching as the arrow perk to reduce the draw time and recover the accuracy malus. The trait perk combination of Archer's Tempo and Kinetic Tremors will make this a great anti-champion weapon with the matching bow Artifact mod. Kinetic Tremors has the second highest combatant damage multiplier on bows and, when enhanced, only needs two hits to proc, so is just free damage against champions once stunned, as well as clearing ads in the area. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Although the Sacred Provenance Aggressive Burst subfamily isn't top tier for pulse rifle PvE damage, it wouldn't take too much to make them shine so it's worth keeping a good roll, just in case. At base the stats are good - 69 Range equates to 38.12m when ADS and 21.18m hipfire, 24 Handling is a 0.47s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.46s stow time, and 36 Reload Speed is a 2.12s reload. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk deals with the wonky Recoil Direction of 70 and adds Handling. High-Caliber Rounds adds useful flinch or Armor-Piercing Rounds works well to the origin trait against shielded enemies. The trait perk combination of Rapid Hit and Kinetic Tremors will make this a great anti-champion weapon with the matching Artifact mod.

Ancient Gospel returns as, for some reason, a void adaptive hand cannon this time with a whole load of PvP trait perks, but not much for PvE fans. At base the stats are solid - 41 Range equates to 29.54m when ADS and 19.69m hipfire, 46 Handling is a 0.34s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.38s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 2.69s reload. Recoil Direction is a perfect 100. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out your preferred stats - you might lean into Range or Handling for the barrel, and Range or Reload Speed with the magazine. There's really only one PvE trait perk roll pairing that works - Destabilizing Rounds and Explosive Payload - also useful against Overload Champions in particular, needing only two shots to disrupt when the artifact mod is around.

Omniscient Eye is a decent choice as a backup damage option against bosses once you're out of heavy ammo. At base the stats are good - 70 Handling equates to a 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow time, and 67 Reload Speed is a 2.74s reload (2.19s with the rapid-fire reload boost is you're reloading an empty magazine). Recoil Direction is a vertical, if loose, 55, magazine size is 6 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 28/30/33/34 (max 41). To land shots, a little extra control is nice - Arrowhead Brake will tighten up the recoil or Polygonal Rifling will reduce bounce as the barrel perk. Tactical Mag will maximise the magazine size and increase total ammo to near maximum levels on its own. As trait perks, in the first column, Lead From Gold improves with your ammo economy, Fourth Time's the Charm will let you hit 11 crits without reloading assuming a mag of 7 shots, or Envious Arsenal is useful when enhanced to maximise reserves (the main perk probably won't be useful as you'll likely have run out of heavy ammo so won't be able to proc the main perk). In the second column Vorpal Weapon offers a flat ×1.15 damage bonus against bosses or, for longer damage phases, Precision Instrument is ×1.2 damage for the rest of the magazine once you've hit 4 quick crits. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Prophet of Doom joins the rather large list of decent raid shotguns, so if you already have one, you might consider passing. At base the stats are good - 67 Range equates to 5.74m, 35 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.45s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 0.76s reload per shell. As it's a precision frame, you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, magazine size is 5 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). If you're still looking for a burst damage weapon, you have One-Two Punch available in the second trait perk column for ×2 melee (once that make director contact with enemies, anyway) ability damage and ×2.5 against bosses and vehicles for 1.22s. Full Choke as the barrel perk makes hitting all your pellets slightly easier and Assault Mag speeds up follow-up shots as the mag perk. Together with One-Two Punch, Reconstruction overflows your magazine passively over time or Pugilist returns 20% melee energy on shotgun kills (although you're more likely to get your kills with your melee so it might be slightly less useful here).

The battery has 7 shots (8 max) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods, total ammo is 19/21/24/25 (max 25). To land all your bolts, you'll need to control the terrible 49 recoil direction wit your barrel perk - Arrowhead Brake is the best way of doing that on controller, although you can probably get away with Fluted Barrel on M+KB.

As it's a precision frame, you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, magazine size is 5 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). If you're still looking for a burst damage weapon, you have One-Two Punch available in the second trait perk column for ×2 melee (once that make director contact with enemies, anyway) ability damage and ×2.5 against bosses and vehicles for 1.22s. You can opt to keep the pellet spread as tight as possible, or boost handling with the barrel perk and Assault Mag or Tactical Mag are good magazine perk choices. There are a few perks that can help with reload in the first trait perk column - Reconstruction passively overfills your mag over time, Threat Remover's stat boosts proc on the same condition as One-Two Punch, or Slideways partially refills after a slide. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create the occasional Ionic Trace from a weapon kill or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Rake Angle gives a kinetic slot Glaive option at last, for anyone dreaming of triple glaive builds. At base the stats are solid - 66 Range equates to 18.60m and a projectile speed of 112.32m/s, 52 Handling is 0.31s ready speed and 0.37s stow speed, Shield Duration of 42 is 11.27s when fully charged, while the Reload Speed of 43 is a 2.75s reload. Mag size is 4 (max is 6) and with 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll start with total ammo of 24/28/31/33 (max is 33).You could look to improve Handling with Tempered Truss Rods or Shield Duration with Auxiliary Reserves as the haft perk, depending on your preference. Appended Mag as the mag perk with Backup Mag maxes out the magazine at 6 shots. The second trait slot perk that makes this special is Chill Clip to slow and disrupt Overload Champions, while two shots will freeze, and stun, Unstoppable Champions - you can also build into Stasis verbs with your fragments. To that end, Overflow is great first trait perk choice, doubling the mag size when picking up ammo even when stowed, giving nine Chill Clip shots. Alternatively, Replenishing Aegis refills the mag when you bock damage with the shield or Lead from Gold helps with the overall ammo economy. The Stunning Recovery origin trait refills the mag, and provides health and Recovery stat bumps after you deal with a Champion, so synergises well.

In the magazine perk slot, Tactical or Appended Mag with Backup Mag get you to the maximum of 7 shots or Assault Mag can be helpful in faster follow-up shots. For burst damage, particularly for Liar's Handshake Hunters, Grave Robber is the best choice in the first trait perk column for automatic magazine refill on melee kills, but Threat Detector can boost Handling, Stability and Reload Speed to 100 so isn't bad either.

Probably the most chased-after Iron Banner PvE weapon in years, Tinasha's Mastery is the first Stasis rocket-assisted sidearm. At base the stats are solid - 28 Range equates to 14.56m when ADS and 12.12m hipfire (although there really isn't that much damage dropoff), 42 Handling is 0.31s ready, 0.25s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 29 is a 1.81s reload. Magazine size is 10 (maximum 16), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods you get total ammo of 40/43/46/48 (max 57). This roll is all about slowing and freezing single targets, so Velocity is far more important to boost than Blast Radius with the barrel and magazine perks. In the first perk trait slot, Air Trigger provides the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced) - useful since the nerf to reserve ammo - as well as speedy reloads if you're in the air when the animation starts. All of this is building up to Chill Clip in the second trait perk column - one shot slows, and disrupts, Overload Champions and three shots freezes, and stuns, Unstoppable champions, which you can synergise with Stasis fragments. Apply Radiant and it'll pierce Barrier champions too. It's bound to be nerfed at some point, so enjoy being totally overpowered for as long as it lasts. With the change to the Skulking Wolf origin trait, at least there is now an effect in PvE to reduce enemy accuracy when it's procced, which could be useful for survivability in more difficult content. Recommended MW: Velocity with a Backup Mag mod or, when enhanced, a Synergy mod to generate Stasis shards or Stunloader when an artifact mod's around.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Yesterday's Questions is a Trials of Osiris reward so not very accessible, and High Impact rocket launchers are only mid-tier for base damage so if you have a good boss damage RL already, you can safely pass. At base the stats are good - 45 Velocity equates to 34.85m/s, 67 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.39s ADS and 0.33s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 35 is a 3.34s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 10/11/12/12 (max 13). For a sustained DPS weapon there's going to be weapon swapping going on, so you'll need a handling barrel perk. Impact Casing as the magazine perk adds a little extra damage (×1.022). As a trait perk pairing, Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch proc on the same condition of of doing damage with your other weapons to reload and boost damage by ×1.35. But if you don't get that, Air Trigger when enhanced maxes out your ammo reserves at 13 and (if you can bunny hop when the reload amination starts) reduce reload time to 2.31s.

In the second column, Explosive Light boosts damage by ×1.25 for six rockets (7 when enhanced) or Bipod just allows you to shoot multiple rockets without reloading.

// Red Tape
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Red Tape doesn't do anything exceptional but it does play into Stasis shenanigans if you use the crystals to gain a new sightline. You don't have to be near the Stasis crystal or enemy which means you can get Frost Armor from anywhere across the map. Keep Away and Lone Wolf also lean into this but don't give as many benefits. Explosive Payload would be great for fighting duals as the extra flinch is incredibly frustrating to fight against." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Insurmountable
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Insurmountable looks to be a decent Void sidearm for most activities. The issue is most sidearms don't scare up to GM levels easily.

Vorpal Weapon is second best but better for solo or dual fireteams." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for backup sustained Boss special weapon damage in general, and end-game underleveled content. There was a time when slug shotties like Legato-11 were the meta for CQC Boss damage. They're still decent, mind, and it wouldn't take much of a buff for their glory days to return. At base the stats are very good - 65 Range equates to 9.22m while ADS and 7.69m hipfire, 68 Handling is 0.32s ready speed, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 48 is a 0.72s reload per shell. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 19/20/22/23 shots (maximum is 23) and magazine size of 6 (maximum is 8). Slug SGs have the same vertical recoil boost as Precisions, so you can largely ignore recoil direction, and use the barrel perk to boost Handling. You have options for the magazine perk - Assault Mag increases your fire rate, and thus DPS. You can hit the maximum mag size of 8 with either Tactical Mag (which also boosts Stability and Reload Speed) or Appended Mag and a Backup Mag mod. Or you can boost Range and Reload Speed with Light Mag. For sustained boss damage, you can go one of two ways - Triple Tap will let you shoot 12 times before reloading with the max mag size of 8, or Auto-Loading Holster lets you swap to a kinetic slot slug SG continue DPS while it reloads in the background. For a damage perk, Vorpal Weapon or Frenzy (which also maxes out Handling and Reload Speed when procced) boost damage by ×1.15, or Focused Fury can provide ×1.2 damage after you've hit crits with your first four shots. The Suros Synergy origin trait only procs after a manual reload, but it's always nice to have extra handling.

Live Fire is a decent stasis scout rifle, if you're looking for one, offering better integration with the Stasis verb toolkit than previous versions. At base the stats are decent (except for maybe Reload Speed) - 45 Range equates to 74.61m while ADS and 37.31m hipfire, 46 Handling is 0.41s ready speed, 0.33s ADS speed and 0.39s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 40 is a 2.18s reload. With this being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the recoil direction stat, and use the barrel perk to boost Handling. Look for Reload Speed-bosting mag perks, although Armor-Piercing Rounds is another utility option for your vault for when scout rifles have the seasonal artefact anti-barrier mod, for a ×1.05 damage boost to shields and barriers. For Stasis synergy, the combination of Rimestealer and Headstone gives you Stasis crystals on crit kills, and Frost Armor stacks when you shatter them for AoE damage, which you can use fragments to enhance further. The Field Forged origin trait does boost gunfeel stats very subtly but, if you can stay alive to keep collecting stacks, you will start feeling the benefit at higher tiers as you rack up hits and kills.

Veleda-F is, hopefully, a harbinger future void snipers that we can consider in a fireteam's loadout for major and boss damage, even though aggressive frames aren't the optimal choice for damage. At base the stats are average - 47 Zoom, 80 Range, 30 Handling is 0.43s ready speed, 0.44s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 27 is a 3.26s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 21/23/24/25 shots (max is 27) and magazine size of 3 (maximum 5). Both Handling and Reload Speed could do with a little help with barrel and magazine perks, although there's also something to be said for a larger capacity mag too. Air Trigger in the first trait perk column provides the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced) for more total ammo and, if you can co-ordinate starting reloading during a jump, adds 30 to Reload Speed and a ×0.8 reload animation duration. Withering Gaze in the second column applies the same weaken debuff as Divinity - effectively a ×1.15 boost to damage for 6s for the whole fireteam, so could be used in combination with a Boss damage heavy weapon. Interestingly, you can also extend the timer of sources of 30% weaken, such as Felwinter's Helm and Tractor Cannon (but not Hunter Tethers unfortunately) by using Withering Gaze to reapply the debuff. Hopefully in future we'll see the trait in the first column of a sniper rifle. If you're interested, Veleda was a priestess and prophet of the Bructeri Germanic tribe during the Batavian rebellion against Rome in 69–70 CE. The Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait increases damage against vehicles (×1.15), constructs (×1.3) and Stasis crystals (×1.45), which can be situationally useful.

With this being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the recoil direction stat. Corkscrew Rifling adds a little bit of everything as the barrel perk, and Armor-Piercing Rounds is decent option to overpenetrate targets and a ×1.05 damage boost to shields and barriers - useful for when the anti-barrier seasonal artifact mod's around. For Stasis synergy, the combination of Rimestealer and Headstone gives you Stasis crystals on crit kills, and Frost Armor stacks when you shatter them for AoE damage, which you can use fragments to enhance further.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Over in the crucible you've got a few things to keep in mind. AST base Jurassic Green hits out to 30.64m. at max you're only gaining ~5m. The better play is to invest your stats into consistency perks. Closing Time and Lone Wolf are both new and exciting perks but Keep Away is tried and true. Kill Clip will make follow up kills easier and depending on your build you could go for Adrenaline Junkie or even Desperate Measures. Headseeker is the best neutral option in the fourth column."

Arcane Embrace is the first of a new subfamily of Heavy Burst shotguns, which look like they might be the new top pick for special weapon boss DPS, doing 9.88% more damage that slug shotguns if both shits hit. The stats look similar to Pin Point Slug shotties too, and by that standard are pretty decent. At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 26/29/33/34, but you can chew through ammo fast, firing two shots with each trigger pull. The usual play for shotguns of boosting handling with the barrel perk still applies and, as there's no Assault Mag, look to a magazine perk that helps with Reload Speed. For sustained boss damage, once you're out of heavy ammo, the perk trait combination of Fourth Time's the Charm and Precision Instrument, if you can consistently hit a boss crit spot to take advantage of the up to ×1.25 boost to precision damage and extend your mag. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced.

Void rapid-fire grenade launcher Acosmic returns with a couple of new tricks for a boss damage. The stats look decent out of the box. At base, 25 Handling translates to 0.48s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.43 stow speed, and with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 33/35/37/38 shots. For boss damage, Hard Launch as the barrel perk squeezes a tiny bit more damage out of Spike Grenades, but otherwise look for one that boosts velocity. Air Trigger may sound like a weird recommendation for the first trait perk, but it's more for the additional reserves - equivalent to 1.5 reserve mods (2 mods when enhanced) and, as long as you start your reload animation while in the air, the whole reload will be sped up. You'll need a fast reload to use with Bait and Switch for the ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced, but don't overlook Nadir Focus for extra velocity. If you're interested, Acosmic is named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense (according to Merriam-Webster). Recommended MW: Velocity or Reload Speed (if it's Blast Radius, leave it well alone with Spike Grenades) depending on your preference, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to generate Void Breaches, or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss enemies in end-game content. Mechabre (it's so obviously a Transformers pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. At base, Handling of 26 equates to 0.44s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.39s stow speed, and Reload Speed of 30 is a 3.20s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 22/24/26/26 of a max total ammo of 27. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk, and then Appended Mag with a Backup Mag mod gets you to the maximum of 5 in the mag. If you don't have a well-rolled rapid-fire sniper for backup boss damage, you could start in the first trait perk slot with one of Triple Tap (7 crits before reload), Clown Cartridge (6-8 shots before reload), or Air Trigger to boost Reload Speed by +30 when you start the reload animation off the ground and boost total ammo by the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced). Combine one of those with Firing Line for a ×1.2 damage boost in a fireteam or Vorpal Weapon for a flat ×1.15 boost to majors and bosses in the second. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Champions in general and end-game, underleveled, content. Void rapid-fire grenade launcher Acosmic returns with a couple of new tricks for a boss damage. The stats look decent out of the box. At base, 25 Handling translates to 0.48s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.43 stow speed, and with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 33/35/37/38 shots. Look for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and/or Handling together with Spike Grenades as the magazine perk. For burst damage, Clown Cartridge in the first trait perk column lets you take full advantage of Explosive Light's up to 6 shots (7 when enhanced) of ×1.25 bonus damage just for picking up power orbs, in the second. If you're interested, Acosmic is named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense (according to Merriam-Webster). The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced, but don't overlook Nadir Focus for extra velocity. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed depending on your preference, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to generate Void Breaches or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Jolting Feedback is a great end-game trait perk, applying Jolt on the 16th bullet (12 when Amplified) - and one fewer (15 and 11) when Enhanced - and not requiring a kill to proc.

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades.

Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 - that aside, the stats are decent.

For a utility roll that uses Disorienting Grenades as the magazine perk, Blast Radius is irrelevant as it'll always end up at 0, so use the barrel perk to boost Velocity and Handling with Quick Launch. For Stasis synergy, the combination of new-to-season-25 Rimestealer and Chill Clip should disorient and slow enemies up to and including Champions and Minibosses - Whisper of Durance on a Stasis subclass will extend the slow effect.

At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a general purpose crowd control roll, maximise the Blast Radius with Volatile Launch and then, as there's no other magazine perk options that really work, Spike Grenades provides a ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts. As the trait perks, in the first column Rimestealer can work if you have access to other Stasis verbs as part of your build, to generate Frost Armor on frozen enemy kills or stasis crystal shattering, or bypass reloads with Slideways. In the second, Chill Clip pairs well with Rimestealer, One for All procs easily on double-fire GLs for a ×1.35 damage boost, or Chain Reaction adds AoE damage on enemy kills and boosts ammo reserves when enhanced. The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload. For anyone interested, a liturgy is a form or formulary according to which public religious worship, is conducted.

Range on sidearms is pretty compressed, so a barrel perk offering Handling is probably your first choice, maybe with a touch of Stability if you're on controller. In the magazine, look for perks that provide extra shots or faster reloads.

You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size and reload speed. But what makes this weapon special is the combination of Eddy Current to boost reload and handling when procced, and the new-to-season-25 Jolting Feedback trait which will passively apply Jolt to targets after 15 hits on enemies (or 11 when amplified) - great for additional chunk damage on a target and clearing nearby adds with the AoE damage.

Sovereignty is a void adaptive Sniper Rifle with overall in-band stats so, unfortunately it's not as good as a rapid-fire as a backup boss damage weapon. At base, it has 45 Zoom, 40 Handling which equates to 0.39s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 39 is a 3.04s reload. Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 21/23/25/26. You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size - Appended or Extended Mag with a Backup Mag mod takes total ammo to 25/27/29/30. Combined with the origin trait, you can potentially get 10 in an overflowed mag (13 when the weapon's enhanced). In the second trait perk column is the new-to-season-25 Withering Gaze, which can apply void Weaken global debuff from a safe distance after ADSing for 1.5s (to possibly pair with Echoes of Harvest and Starvation?), for a ×1.15 damage boost while active. There's nothing much that synergises in the first column, so Explosive Payload is tried and trusted for a bit of extra damage, and some flinch. The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload.

Bitter/Sweet is an arc adaptive grenade launcher with decent stats. At base, it has 39 Handling which equates to 0.44s ready, 0.43s ADS speed and 0.40s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 42 is a 3.22s reload. Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 25/27/28/29. For an excellent boss damage roll, boost the Velocity and Handling with the barrel perk, and add Spike Grenades for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts in the magazine. If you lean into the origin trait, this could result in an overflowed magazine of 10 (13 when the weapon is enhanced!). The new-for-season-25 Envious Arsenal in the first trait perk column procs on the same condition as Bait and Switch, so a full weapon damage rotation will reload the base magazine from reserves and provide a further ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. If you can proc the excellent Dark Ether origin trait before DPS starts, you can overflow the magazine by ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.2 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE utility pick for crowd control in both general and end-game, underleveled content, particularly with Stasis builds. Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 - that aside, the stats are decent. At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a utility roll that uses Disorienting Grenades as the magazine perk, Blast Radius is irrelevant as it'll always end up at 0, so use the barrel perk to boost Velocity, and Handling if possible. For Stasis synergy, the combination of new-to-season-25 Rimestealer and Chill Clip should disorient and slow enemies up to and including Champions and Minibosses - Whisper of Durance on a Stasis subclass will extend the slow effect. With other sources of slow and freeze, shattering frozen targets (and Stasis crystals) grants a stack of Frost Armor - two stacks when enhanced.

Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 (which is actually a plus for this roll), the stats are decent. At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. Counter-intuitively, for single-target damage, the lower the blast radius, the more damage you cause, so reduce the low BR even further with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and Implosion Rounds in the magazine - although Spike Grenades, for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts, is also very good. If you're using this in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation, Envious Arsenal in the first trait column will reload (and also boosts ammo reserves by the equivalent of 1 reserves mod, or 2 when enhanced), or if not, and you're moving between damage plates, Slideways does the same. There's no useful damage perk in the second column, but if you have Chill Clip, then you can use Prismatic's Facet of Courage for a ×1.1 damage multiplier with a light-based heavy weapon or super. You won't get much use from the excellent Dark Ether origin trait from this roll, unfortunately, as it's more about setting up for boss damage than kills.

If you're going all in to an army of Threadlings build, the Weaver's Call aspect is an obvious choice, and you'll probably want Facet of Honor, Awakening and maybe Solitude to create more Tangles and benefit from destroying them, or your own choice of fragments to boost the utility of your grenade, melee and rift, and gameplay preferences.

This cries out for use with the Gambler's Dodge class ability to keep you punching, dodging and regenerating health, the Combination Blow melee, Grapple grenade, and Winter's Shroud and Stylish Executioner aspects for a pretty much one-Guardian army (while there are Minor adds to kill, anyway), although be warned that sometimes the damage can be confusingly inconsistent.

Your build will focus on grenade ability regeneration, to use with Unbreakable, and super damage - so Facets of Courage, for additional ability damage against darkness-debuffed targets, Balance, to boost to grenade energy on darkness kills, Purpose, for DR or healing on an orb pickup, and Solitude to sever targets to use with Courage all look like useful additions to the kit, together with a Stasis or Strand Demolitionist weapon and a Light-based super.

Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17 and, unfortunately its stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Enhanced Battery boosts the total ammo to 456 (508/559/585) and Ionized Battery gets you to 461 (513/565/591). For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait perk is always useful to pick up ammo blocks and power orbs, but also reloads all your weapons, bypassing reload penalties. In the second, One for All provides an easy to proc a ×1.35 damage boost, or Desperate Measures is easy to proc while Transcendent with grenade and melee kills, for up to a ×1.3 boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? For anyone interested, the name's derived from Greek words "chronos" and "phage", literally meaning "time-eater" and is used colloquially in French to mean "time-consuming".

Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. In the first trait perk column, Rapid Hit helps with both recoil control and reload on crit hits, while to boost damage, Kinetic Tremors is good for a bit of flinch and AoE damage after 6 hits, or Explosive Payload does much the same job is a smaller area.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors, Minibosses and Champions in end-game content. Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, the maximum battery size of 7 shots, can be achieved with Enhanced or Ionized Battery (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s), plus Backup Mag and the Reservoir Burst trait. In the first trait perk slot, for burst damage, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. Reservoir Burst will apply a ×1.25 damage boost to the first 2-5 shots, and proc an explosion on a kill for chunky AoE damage. Unless you're using a ranged melee, you probably won't see much benefit from the Cast No Shadows origin trait which reloads, and boosts handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17 and, unfortunately its stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Backup Mag on its own added gets you to the maximum of 461 (513/565/591), so you can opt for Particle Repeater for more stability, or Light Battery for Handling and Reload Speed. For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait perk is always useful to pick up ammo blocks and power orbs, but also helpfully reloads all your weapons. In the second, One for All provides an easy to proc a ×1.35 damage boost, or Desperate Measures is easy to proc while Transcendent with grenade and melee kills, for up to a ×1.3 boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love? For anyone interested, the name's derived from Greek words "chronos" and "phage", literally meaning "time-eater" and is used colloquially in French to mean "time-consuming".

Speleologist's stats are on the low side, unfortunately, but there are still some very usable rolls. At base, 28 Range equates to 46.60m while ADS, 49 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.40s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 61 is a 4.59s reload.

On controller, you're going to find the recoil difficult - Arrowhead Brake is the obvious choice as the barrel perk to straighten recoil direction, and the additional Handling is useful on M+KB too. Controllers might even benefit from Steady Rounds as the magazine perk too, but if you can keep to short, controlled bursts (like Cpl Hicks advises) then use Extended Magazine to increase mag size. As your trait perk combination, Envious Assassin works quietly in the background to overfill your magazine by up to 200%, depending on the circumstances, giving you plenty of ammo to use with Killing Tally's up to a ×1.3 damage boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE utility pick for use against major and boss enemies in end-game content, particularly with Strand builds. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by 40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune). In the second column Vorpal Weapon boosts damage by ×1.2 against majors and bosses with no proccing, which makes this an excellent choice for use in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add clearing Minor in end-game content. Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. If you're able to hit consistent crits, the trait perk combination of Triple Tap and either Precision Instrument or Focused Fury will help keep the higher damage stacks up for longer before reloading. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. For an easy ×1.2 damage boost with easy proccing conditions (just stand near your fireteam), Firing Line is still a decent choice.

Even if you hit 100 recoil, it's still tough to control on controller, so look to boost stability with your barrel and mag perks - a little extra reload speed never hurts too. If you want a primary to use in a boss damage phase, particularly on Hunter, then Slice will sever after a dodge reload, for -40% damage reduction to outgoing boss damage. While you're not going to be using this as your primary damage option, Chaos Reshaped should be procced while stowed for both stacks, so you should get the +35% damage and maybe a burst of healing when you use it with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

Shapeable. Summon Bonum is a Latin expression meaning "the supreme good from which all others are derived", and also now an interesting sword too. Stats are pretty much uniform with swords, and this is our first legendary wave frame - much like a a grenade launcher with the heavy attack, with a follow-up targeted attack - hopefully to finish off a weakened enemy. For a boss damage roll, Jagged Edge - with an Backup Mag mod and three reserves mods you'll have 68 ammo, only 2 shy of the maximum of 70 - and Swordmaster's Guard are the usual safe pairing for the blade and guard perks. In trait column one you've got a choice - Relentless Strikes returns one ammo for every third hit but Attrition Orbs might not be the worst call as, with the heavy wave attack you'll get multiple hits counting towards the 10 you need to generate an orb, which you can use to keep weapon surges active, and heal. In the second column Bait and Switch offers a 35% damage bonus when procced, or you could use Whirlwind Blade for up to 30%, Surrounded (depending on the encounter and whether you have adds around or not) for +35% (+41.75% when enhanced). Chaos Reshaped might work, but it'll depend how long you're out of combat (you only have 5s of not dealing or taking damage) before a boss damage phase begins.

Base stats are excellent by comparison to its peers, and equate to 0.45s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.39s stow speed, and 3.30s reload speed. Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - so Fluted Barrel is the barrel perk to choose, and Arrowhead Brake is decent. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots (so maybe a reload mod on your boots will help?). That's important for Chill Clip in the first trait slot, as it means you'll have three Chill Clip shots. For anti-Champion use, one shot will slow and disrupt an Overload champion and two will freeze and stun an Unstoppable (with a third stot ready, just in case). You can also pierce barriers by simply becoming radiant, and all at a nice, safe range. The second column trait is less important as this is more of a utility roll, but Chaos Reshaped is likely to have built up two stacks in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost, or Explosive Payload provides a small damage boost without any proccing needed. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

You can use any grenade, but Grapple grenade with the melee follow-up also counts to proc Caliban's. For the melee ability, the Threaded Spike melee can chain multiple ignitions, or a more traditional Combination Blow is a natual pairing to the Liar intrinsic side. Then Gambler's Dodge near enemies to get your melee back and repeat until the room's clear. The Caliban ignitions will stun Overload champions, but as you'll be up close, you might need to think about a bit of invisibility, damage resistance and/or healing somewhere else in your subclass setup and armour mods. So maybe try Stylish Executioner and Winter's Shroud Aspects (dodge applies slow nearby, and then killing slowed enemies makes you invisible), and then Facets of Sacrifice, Courage, Dawn, Protection, and Ruin - Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions. If you're looking for healing then, maybe swap out Sacrifice for Blessing, which starts health regeneration on melee kills. And, seeing as you're asking, Relativism is a philisophical theory that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Throwing the grenade in either case with Cyrtarachne grants Woven Mail for -45% damage reduction. With Renewal, you're restricted to Duskfield Grenades, but they are good with the slowing and freezing effective on Overload and Unstoppable Champions, plus Renewal's effect of reducing damage output from enemies by -50% and providing allies with Frost Armour. With Spirit of Inmost Light, you can use any grenade (although Duskfield is still very good) and rely on the short cooldown of your Gambler's Dodge with Combination Blow to keep the fast ability regeneration going.

Synthoceps boosts melee damage by 200% while in CQC with 3 or more enemies, while Inmost Light helps recover your melee energy as fast as possible by using your other abilities. Choose Frenzied Blade to start with three charges to sue with Consecration, Thruster or Rally Barricade for the shortest cooldown, and a Grapple grenade for another source of darkness debuff. You can pair that with a Drengr's Lash or Diamond Lance Aspect for even more sources of darkness debuffs. For fragments, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Ruin play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Consecration), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions.

Neither is particulary strong in an endgame environment on their own, so probably not for a GM Nightfall. You'll obviously need to use the Drengr's Lash Aspect, but the other is dealer's choice and Fragments of Hope, Courage, Protection and Purpose play well - picking up orbs applies a beneficial subclass verb to yourself with Purpose, and while that verb is active Hope boosts the barricade ability recharge rate on kills; Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent) and Courage boosts the scorch damage on a suspended enemy.And, seeing as you're asking, Stoicism is a philisophical theory holding that wise people should be free from passion, unmoved by joy or grief.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-God M+KB Controller

Maybe one to use with a full set of Pale Heart weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin trait, for faster super recharge - with two excellent Strand weapons in the set, in The Call and Pro Memoria, that would pair well with the Needlestorm super, so you can use your super for burst damage on a boss and get straight into weapons and ability spam.

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades.

// Spirit of the Necrotic, Spirit of the Claw;
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for melee-focussed builds, but there's also some synergy with the Weapons of Sorrow and glaive lovers. It's pretty simple - Claw provides an additional melee charge, Necrotic melees poison enemies and killing poisoned enemies spreads the poison. The additional damage isn't huge, but it prevents shield regeneration and lets you keep track of an enemy's position. Necrotic also works with glaive melee attacks (so you might want to bring one with the "Close to Melee" trait perk) and Weapons of Sorrow, and Claw also works with the Song of Flame exotic to give you two finger snaps. Alongside this in a prismatic build, Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges at base, and four with Claw and you can choose pretty much any grenade. For Aspects, Feed the Void will proc Devour on an ability kill, paired with Lightning Surge to use melee charges to Jolt enemies or Hellion for solar scorching and kills. Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Blessing play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Jolt or the Hellion mortar), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), Blessing starts health regeneration on melee kills, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), and Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more Jolt/Hellion damage against frozen/unravelled enemies).

Stag and Vesper is a simple, proc-free combination to drop your rift while Ghost decrypts the same code its been working on for the last 10 years in the Devil's Lair, and gain x2 Resist for a damage reduction of -25% with Horn, and send out a regular arc shockwave to dissuade any meleeing enemies with nefarious intentions with Vesper. If you want to summon a personal army while you're there, the Hellion and Weaver's Call Aspects both proc on a rift cast. Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges which apply strand unravelling to enemies, and the grenade if dealer's choice - Healing Grenade if you want another source of healing, Coldsnap if you want a source of darkness debuff, or Storm or Vortex to damage enemies. Alongside those you might consider Facets of Sacrifice to generate bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills while you have light elemental buff, Devotion to grant bonus light transcendent energy ftom killing enemies debuffed by darkness debuffs, Hope to recover ability energy while you have an elemental buff, Purpose to provide an elemental buff on power orb pickup, and Protection to give you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent).

The Riposte is the Final Shape expansion's Competitive playlist reward - a unique Lightweight frame AR which grants the usual +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed with the fire rate of a rapid-fire. Base stats equate to 24.00m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.30s ADS speed, 0.38s ready and 0.35s stow speed, and 1.79s reload speed, which compares well with the raid rapid-fire AR Rufus's Fury. Recoil is not great on controller, but stability barrel and mag perks can help, and you also get a choice of stocks that can assist too - Fitted Stock adds 20 Recoil Directions and 10 Stability for a small Handling loss. Aim to get to around 80 Stability, and you should be fine. If control isn't so much of an issue for you, then Short Action Stock or Composite Stock will boost Handling for a snappier gunfeel. For add-clearing, the void trait perk pairing of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds work really well together, and synergise with builds using void aspects and fragments.

As a precision, you doing have to worry about Recoil Direction, so you can spec into your preferred stats with the barrel perk, and reload speed in the mag slot. The trait perk pairing of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds work well to clear crowds at the CQC distances you'll be using an SMG in, and synergise with builds using void aspects and fragments.

It fires slowly enough for recoil not to be too much of an issue, so you can focus on Handling and Reload Speed with the barrel and mag perks. Unusually, there's a damage perk in the first trait column - High-Impact Reserves, so you can double up damage multipliers in the second column with Frenzy for +15% and maxxed handling and reload speed. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the pulse rifle's decent damage multiplier and any damage bonus, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

The weapon itself has quite poor stats but it boasts some great, and unique, possible trait perk pairings. You can go with any barrel perk of your preference, other than Smoothbore or Rifled Barrel. Assault Mag and then Tactical Mag are the best of the magazine perks. As a slightly off-piste choice, the trait perk pairing of Discord and Chain Reaction - which is excellent on shotguns as the explosion damage also inherits the damage scaling - or Surrounded for +47% damage when enhanced, will allow you to get a kill with your other weapon, and then go on a tear for 7s refunding every killing shot fired.

We have the same consistency perks in Dynamic Sway Reduction and Killing Wind while also picking up Keep Away to boost range in lieu of Accurized Rounds. Kill Clip is still the best perk for chaining but Tap the Trigger for consistency or Target Lock are both good options." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,controller

Wild Style has returned with a refreshed perk pool and has gone from meh to must have. If you get Disorientating Grenades as the magazine perk, this automatically reduces blast radius to 0 in which case just use the barrel perk to improve velocity and handling. This mag perk disorients enemies up to boss-tier, helping manage firefights with both large groups and more difficult individual adds. As the first column trait perk, Reconstruction is just a better Auto-Loading Holster, overfilling to 2 in the magazine, or Envious Assassin needs a bit more setup but can overflow the mag to 3 shots. Then, Vorpal Weapon in the second column provides a reliable +15% damage. The Tex Balanced Stock origin trait is probably the most useful of the three, unless there's a GL artifact mod in which case use Stunning Recovery. Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling mod.

Wanna fire the same Precision AR as Zavala? Origin Story returns with a refreshed (if huge) perk pool. If you're focussing make sure you've reset your reputation a few times first. The precision frame makes recoil easier to handle but the stats are on the low side, so you can use the barrel and magazine perks to fill them out a little. You've got a choice of first column support perks to add utility, boost gunfeel stats or directly improve reload speed. In the second column, Onslaught can dramatically improve outgoing damage as you're killing adds. Either Origin Trait can work, depending on whether you want a little bit of health or slightly improved gunfeel. The perk pool is huge, so reset Vanguard rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: any - dealer's choice, with a Backup Mag mod.

Scintillation (that is, the process of being sparkly) is the first Strand adaptive burst LFR. It's got decent stats and feels good to use, and the Veist Stinger, while not the powerhouse it once more, is still the best origin trait to have on an LFR. With this being a three shot burst, you'll imp[rove control with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk. The best battery perk is Enhanced Battery which, with a Backup Mag mod, is your first step towards the maximum 7 shots but, if you get Accelerated Coils that also works to improve DPS rate at the cost of a small drop to total damage. In the first trait column, Envious Assassin can triple your number of shots to 21 - pretty much all of your reserve ammo. In the second, Reservoir Burst is the final step to get to 7 shots in the base battery, adds +25% damage to every overflowed shot and, if you kill your target, the explosion is 4x stronger than Chain Reaction would be. Recommended MW: Handling or Charge Time, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use in end-game content. The re-reprised Warden's Law was the first of the heavy burst subfamily, and provides good, if slightly clunky-feeling damage. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both also do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. Using Tactical Mag or Appended Mag as the magazine perk, with a Backup Mag mod, will bring the magazine to its maximum of 14. The two shot burst makes this useful for disrupting overloads - you can look for a first column trait perk that helps with gunfeel or ammo economy, to pair with Vorpal Weapon in the second for a little extra damage against majors and bosses. TYhe Stunning Recovery origin trait pairs well for this anti_champion role. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

The stats are pretty much in-band, although there aren't many peers to compare against, but you'll definitely appreciate some extra handling and reload speed, so focus on improving those with the barrel and magazine perks. For strand fragment synergy you now have access to both Slice (probably easier to proc for Hunters, with the faster cooldown for Dodge) and Hatchling in the two trait perk columns. The Nadir Focus origin trait is useful to help land repeated crits, so that's the one to choose. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy - information as at v8.0.0.6 (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in general content, particularly with void fragments. Claws of the Wolf returns in season 24 with a largely new (largely PvP-focussed) perk pool, but with stats the look a bit anaemic by comparison with its peers. The Recoil Direction needs a bit of attention, so Arrowhead Brake is the obvious barrel perk to sort that out. In the magazine perk slot, you could either look to fill out the stats a little more, or get a combat effect mag perk. If you don't already have an Elsie's Rifle with the void combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds in the two trait perk columns, then this roll can synergise with void fragments to boost the subclass verbs and provide a void overshield while clearing groups of adds. Unfortunately, the Skulking Wolf origin trait has no effect outside of Iron Banner. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

Veiled Threat looks lovely (like Vex Mytholast had a baby!) but unfortunately drops with poor base stats compared to its peers, so if you have a Krait you're happy with you can probably pass on by. If you're shooting adds at the outer reach of its range (22.6m at base), you might appreciate a little extra stability on controller, otherwise maybe a bit of extra range or stability with the barrel perk. In the mag slot, Alloy Mag can double down on the intrinsic frame perk to reduce reload time from 1.83s to 1.24s when empty, or Tactical Mag (1.68s) or Flared Magwell (1.61s) work at any point in the magazine if you can't wait. There's an interesting interaction between Shoot to Loot in the first trait perk column and the Radiolaria Transposer origin trait when procced - any ammo caught in the pool will be picked up. In the second, to boost damage, Desperate Measures adds up to +30% or Collective Action adds a flat +20%, and both are easy to proc with Transcendence. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like?

Shapeable. Lost Signal is the first of a new special grenade launcher "area denial" subfamily which, from this example, has promise. You can think of this as a baby Witherhoard or a stasis flamethrower, firing five projectiles per shot that form flame pools where they hit something (even in the air). Use the barrel perk to boost handling and velocity - Quick Launch is best with Smart Drift Control as a second choice, and High-Velocity Rounds is the best of the two magazine perks. In the first trait column, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses the need to worry about reload speed, or Stats for All can boost Handling and Reload Stats to 100. In the second, as the raw AoE damage isn't huge, One for All can easily boost damage by a hefty +35% and all the damage ticks are great for recovering darkness Transcendence energy.

Shapeable. Sightline Survey is essentially how non-Raiding Guardians can craft an arc hand cannon. But, if you already have a Posterity, you can move along! The stats are towards the bottom of comparators although on the plus side, with the frame intrinsic, at least you don't have to worry about recoil direction. Handling could definitely do with a boost from the barrel perk - Fluted Barrel is best, with maybe Corkscrew Rifling instead if that's all the drops. you can boost Reload Speed, which is a poor 2.54s at base, with the magazine perk - Flared Magwell (2.29s), or Tactical Mag (2.37s). In the first trait perk column, Enlightened Action. You get three stacks per hit, so four hits will grant +50 Handling and Reload Speed for 2s, reducing reload time to 1.83s, or Triple Tap will extend your magazine size. Finally, in the second trait slot, Desperate Measures can bost damage by up to +30%, and is easy to proc with Transcendence.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits (there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up) which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. The first and second trait column perks can double down on the frame intrinsic perks through Physic which grants x1 Restoration (x2 when enhanced) for 5s to both you and allies when procced, and Circle of Life which boosts damage on healing by an additional +25% for 10s (+37.5% total for the first 5s with the Support Frame Boost) for both you and the healed Guardian.

First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. In the first trait column Physic grants x1 Restoration (x2 when enhanced) for 5s to both you and allies while, in the second, Incandescent is great for red bar add crowd control or Frenzy is great for all-round utility, boosting damage by +26.5% when procced with the frame intrinsic, along with maxxed-out handling and reload.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits (there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up) which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. There aren't many comparators for Bold Endings - the good news is that the base stats are great, but the bad news is that they're still not very good, with stability, handling and reload speed all low so, although it's hard-hitting, it feels a bit clunky. Use the barrel and magazine perks to fill in the gaps. To help further, you can quickly get to the maximum stacks of Rapid Hit as the first trait perk, and you have ways of getting to three stacks of Desperate Measures using Transcendent melee and grenade for up to +30% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against major and bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you already have a good backup DPS sniper then you can safely pass on Embraced Identity. Decent base stats so, as ever, handling is the stat to boost with the barrel perk. Tactical Mag plus a Backup Mag mod gets you to 6 shots, or Appended Mag + Backup Mag gets you to 7. In the first trait column, Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction are both excellent. In the second column, Precision Instrument or High Ground both boost damage via different proc mechanisms, depending on whether you have a big crit spot to aim for, or can get your feet at least one metre higher than the feet of what you're shooting at (so, weirdly, you can have it procced and still be shooting up at a taller enemy's head).

First-choice PvE pick for Minor and Major add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. The Call is the best weapon to come from the Pale Heart weapon set. There's only one other rocket-assisted frame, so there's not much to compare against, but the stats don't honestly matter. You'd normally look for velocity in a non-hitscan weapon, but there's an argument to be made for blast radius too so the barrel and mag perk choices depend on your preference (although be aware that High-Explosive Ordnance will reduce the base mag size to 9). This is going to one-hit kill red bars in most content, so Subsistence is a good choice to bypass reloading entirely, or Lead from Gold will help with the already good ammo economy in the first trait perk column. In the second, One for All can proc from AoE damage ticks - which is why you might want to focus on blast radius - for +35% bonus damage for 10s.

First-choice PvE pick for burst DPS against Majors and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. Someday has in-band stats and is the only kinetic precision frame shotgun currently available.

As the support perk in the first trait column, Threat Detector and Lead for Gold are viable options, or the new Threat Remover looks interesting. Then in the second column, this is the only non-Raid shotgun, and the first pellet shotgun, that can roll with Recombination, which adds up to +100% damage to the next shot, ideal for tanky enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for backup DPS against Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you don't already have a fusion rifle for backup DPS, Axial Lacuna is available and shapeable. If you're interested, a lacuna is a gap or blank space, so the name refers to something missing in the direction of an axis. Improve your handling with your barrel perk, and then with your battery, Accelerated Coils is probably the top choice, but there's also something to be said for the extra shots you'll get from Enhanced Battery. there's nothing better than Reconstruction in the first trait perk slot, doubling your battery's capacity for a damage phase. In the second trait slot, Controlled Burst is the go-to trait for bonus damage, both adding +20% damage and reducing charge time for just landing all your bolts.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two AoE damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - and Dragonfly adds to the fun with a solar explosion and a reload boost on a crit kill.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments.

The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Hammerhead has lots of competition in the void Adaptive-frame LMG subfamily.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk.

The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Retraced Path was our first legendary Trace Rifle, and has some very useful combinations.

Shoot to Loot is really useful in raids and end-game content, particularly if you're a Warlock running Cenotaph Mask to mark targets. You have a range of second-column trait perk options - One For All is an easily triggered 35% damage boost, or Golden Tricorn provides a useful 15% with one stack or 50% with two (easily achieved with the solar toolkit!). The Hot Swap origin trait is always useful for a snappier gunfeel when you swap weapons.

Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. While Eager Edge was the unique Dares perk back in the day, it's appeared elsewhere since so Relentless Strikes is probably the more sensible first column trait perk to combine with Surrounded in the second for 35% (41.8% when enhanced) bonus damage when in a crowd.

// Tusk of the Boar (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Hard Launch, Linear Compensator), High-Velocity Rounds, Slice, Chain Reaction
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw) with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with Hunters on Strand subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Tusk of the Boar is the first wave frame grenade launcher, with decent stats in comparison to its energy-slot peers. Generally, you'll want to increase velocity and add a bit of handling if you can with the barrel and mag perks. In the first trait column Slice is very useful against harder-hitting enemies to sever them and reduce their damage output - it's easiest to proc with the Hunter dodge and can be improved with Thread of Continuity. Chain Reaction is the go-to second trait perk for additional explosive AoE damage on kills, to speed add clearing and spread sever over a wider area. Of the origin traits, Field Tested provides solid escalating gunfeel boosts for landing hits, as long as you don't die.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Hitting 3 targets in PvE is certainly easier than hitting multiple targets in PvP. If you can make Stats for All work in PvP I will be impressed. A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column. Wellspring could pair well with Demolitionist for even more ability energy, or Desperate Measures for a damage bonus without needing a weapon kill to start."

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

With the way special ammo is shaking up in the crucible through the meter or boxes, I think some of the best perks for Mountaintop are the swap perks, Harmony and Recombination. Both allow you to build up a higher damage shot to make Mountaintop one shot again, bringing it back to Recluse or another Harmony weapon to flex on all the hunters out there."

For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots.

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction."

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities.

Instead you could opt for consistency perks like Dynamic Sway Reduction, or Tap the Trigger. Threat Detector and Hip-Fire Grip are both excellent but have more limiting use cases; distance and non-ADS respectively.

Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good.

Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well.

Arrowhead Brake is the best in slot for making the recoil direction vertical, but if you don't need that, Corkscrew Rifling or Fluted Barrel for the added stats. Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched.

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If you would like to bring the nanites into PvP I would opt for one of two ways. Arrowhead Brake at the front end for added recoil direction, Accurized Rounds for the extra range. Headseeker or Rapid Hit depending on what you value, and your choice of Short-Action Stock for more handling or Hand-Laid Stock for the most stability. The alternative way is with Fitted Stock to bring you right up to 100 recoil direction meaning you can slot in Smallbore or even Hammer-Forged Rifling for more range. You drop some handling unless you make that up in your barrel."|tags:pvp,controller

// Forbearance (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills.

Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier.

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities.

Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles).

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

Heal Clip and Incandescent are fantastic together and allow you to push out your engagement ranges a bit further because it’s a pulse rifle. The issue I have with this is that Darkest Before is a rapid-fire frame, meaning it does really low damage per shot. Sometimes needing two or even three bursts for a red bar. Almost any other frame would be incredible. What a shame." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Darkest Before
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Darkest Before in PvP lost a little bit of arc shenanigans, but gained a better perk pool. Elemental Capacitor and Headseeker will make for an extremely consistent or snappy pulse on void or solar, respectively. Kill Clip and Heal Clip together make for a lethal and synergistic build. I don’t foresee Darkest Before becoming the king of pulses, but definitely a top contender for those rapid-fires." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed.

However, with a base 28 grenades in the reserves, I will not be using this bad boy exclusively on bosses. Cascade point is a lot of fun too, but you don't get to finish out your 10 mag after Envious has kicked in. For champs and minibosses, the fight is often going to have plenty of adds to explode."

// Hullabaloo
//notes:SirStallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "This weapon for PvP is tricky.. Wave frames are fun, but a heavy wave frame? Who knows, it might be a blast. And I intend to find out, by creating additional blasts and trying to utilise Chain Reaction to net some fun triple kills.. Or more. Imagine more.. It seems that Blast Radius really doesn't bring much to the table for wave frames, and I would assume that the heavy variant is much the same, so Im focusing on velocity to get my nades where they need to be ASAP."

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with arc subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick - you'll likely need to run some ammo reserve mods. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies in end-game content. Unfortunately, Retrofuturist is distinctly meh, so it's only worth hanging onto a roll if it fills a hole in your vault, and even then you'll have to reset your Crucible rank a few times to stand a decent chance of the roll you're after. As a Lightweight shotgun, you do get the +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed and, for some reason, it has a base mags size of 7, but that's where the praise ends. If you're hanging onto one, try a barrel perk that adds Handling, although a bit of range and stability doesn't hurt either. Assault Mag and Tactical Mag are the best mag perk choices, but Appended Mag or Light Mag aren't bad. For burst damage against majors, the trait combination of Auto-Loading Holster and Trench Barrel is decent enough.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts.

Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit.

// Vouchsafe
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Lightweight frames in PvP are in an interesting spot. They don’t kill fast enough to be competitive, and any boosts don’t really elevate the weapon further. Golden Tricorn 2x does allow you to 3 shot any guardian at any resilience at a 0.60 TtK, but it requires two whole kills to get rolling and without additional ability kills you’ll be back at square one before you know it. Taraxippos and Eternal Blazon with Kill Clip or even Tarnished Mettle with Swashbuckler allow you to 3 crit after just one kill." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Waking Vigil
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Let’s talk about power creep. When Waking Vigil released it was a phenomenal arc hand cannon. Outclassed by Nation of Beasts for the best arc hand cannon. With its midlife refresh Waking Vigil was blessed with a reload perk and an AoE perk through Dragonfly. However it was still overshadowed by Nation of Beasts and by then Ancient Gospel. When the hand cannon merger happened, Waking Vigil lost its only claim to fame being a Lightweight hand cannon versus the aforementioned adaptives. While we still have some great perks going on currently, Waking Vigil is just a relic from the past." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Indebted Kindness is extremely interesting in the crucible. Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn’t incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn’t rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Dragoncult Sickle
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Dragoncult Sickle is our last dungeon weapon. Being a strand caster frame might actually benefit the toolkit a bit more. Being able to spread Sever through Slice and Chain Reaction or spawn Threadlings from a distance makes this weapon an incredibly strong addition to an all Strand loadout. It might not be the best for boss damage or the best for add clear, but I think it will find a nice home in some Strand loadouts." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this. As the first trait column support perk, Perpetual Motion adds further stat bonuses just for moving, or Unrelenting's bonus health is useful in CQC, while in the second column as the signature perk, Frenzy boosts the handling and reload speed up to 100 and adds 15% bonus damage when procced. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s (although you can interact with any elemental drop).

Grab Glacioclasm while you can - unusually, for a world-drop weapon it has great stats as a High-Impact fusion rifle.

For the first trait perk, there's really only one to consider, and that's Overflow to instantly double your battery size for picking up ammo.

The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For single target damage it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for boss damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. For burst damage, Relentless Strikes returns ammo on every third hit and Surrounded boosts damage by 35% if there are enemies nearby - this can be useful in crowded boss fights.

It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag as Appended and Extended Mag.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Dragoncult Sickle (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge), Swordmaster's Guard, (Unrelenting, Tireless Blade), (Chain Reaction, Hatchling)
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass.

To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second column as the signature perk, One-Two Punch is great for burst damage against a major or a champion, or even the occasional boss for melee-based builds.

// Swordbreaker (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag improves rate-of-fire or Tactical Mag increases the magazine by one and boosts reload speed. With a shotgun, you're going to be in CQC to proc Threat Detector as the first trait column support perk, to boost reload speed and handling or you could use Subsistence to continually reload your magazine as you get kills, if you're using this more for add-clear rather than single-target damage. In the second column, as the signature perk, the new-to-season-22 Sword Logic could be interesting on a shotgun - you should be able to proc a lower stack pretty easily, and use the damage boost to help activate the higher stacks. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in general content. Shapeable. High Impact Auto-Rifles aren't really first choice for PvE - they do have good range, and the frame intrinsic provides more accuracy when stationary or slow-moving, but Abyss Defiant has great stats and trait combinations, so may be worth a try. Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell offers the biggest boost to reload speed. The fun solar combination when you're not too underlevelled is the new-to-season-22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk, for a burst of Cure for you and anyone nearby when reloading after a kill, and Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk for add control and working with the scorth and ignite verbs.

First-choice PvE pick for Arc synergy add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in end-age content. Shapeable. Oversoul Edict offers the usual rapid-fire intrinsic 20% faster reload animation when the mag is empty and middling stats by comarison with energy slot peers. Controlling the recoil direction means Arrowhead Brake is the best barrel perk, taking it to an almost not terrible 79. Take your choice of rounding out some of the gunfeel stats with Flared Magwell, or any of the combat effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Demolitionist is as great as always for regenerating grenade energy and Adrenaline Junkie in the second column as the signature perk lets you use those grenades for a +33% damage after a kill.

Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice.

Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%.

Start with a barrel perk that boosts handling - Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling both help a little - and Assault Mag improves the low rate of fire. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size for just picking up an ammo brick and then in the second column signature perk slot, to passively boost damage for end-game use you could use Trench Barrel, Frenzy or Collective Action. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

// Nox Perennial V (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments.

Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

// Unending Tempest (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. You'll appreciate a mix of handling, stability and reload speed from your barrel and mag perks. Fluted Barrel is the obvious top pic for the barrel, but Smallbore is a decent alternative, and then Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell boost the stats you need from the mag. In the first trait column as a support perk, both Enlightened Action and Perpetual Motion boost gunfeel stats, while in the second as the signature perk, Collective Action or Surrounded are both solid damage boosting options. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the first choice for the barrel, with Corkscrew Rifling as an alternate choice. Appended Mag adds 2 "shots", or Tactical Mag adds one, but also helps with Stability and Reload Speed. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads. Recommended MW: Stability (with Enlightened Action) or Handling (with Perpetual Motion), with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game (as at v7.2.0.3), and a new and very chasable trait pairing. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost in the barrel, followed by Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can choose any of the combat effect rounds as your mag perk. In the first trait column as the support perk, the new combination worth chasing is Heal Clip, for the Cure for yourself and nearby fireteam on reloads after a kill, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk to maximise handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range. Bungie knew what they were doing when bringing in this weapon as Deadpan Delivery has the second lowest range stat of all Aggressive Frame shotguns even losing to the Uncommon Ded Nemoris II."

// Kept Confidence - PvE (pve,mkb,controller)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Kept Confidence is getting a lot of hype but is it worth it? We have some incredible powerhouses in the same slot. Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon."

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Nightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on. With my roll choices you can have 100 recoil direction with a counterbalance mod and 32m of in game range. Plenty to take advantage of the bonuses of Keep Away."

I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow.

Elemental Capacitor will juice up Void or Arc builds while having slightly less utility on Stasis and negligible effects on Strand and Solar. I would argue it’s better than Target Lock because you’ll only be getting half a magazine in PvP but if the damage scales like I think it does, it could be incredible (I’ll edit this if I am wrong.)"

// Swordbreaker - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Swordbreaker is the returning shotgun from Crota’s End. Here we have a case of “interesting but not incredible.” Being able to get both Pugilist and One-Two Punch is a fantastic combo, but I feel that most people will opt for Subsistence to forget what reloading is like. Demolitionist is good for grenade heavy builds and also for forgetting the reload animation. In the final column, One-Two Punch is the best in slot, but on a Strand ability focused build you can get away with Golden Tricorn for even more damage. Sword Logic is also here if you want to run through enemies like Doom Guy and shotgun everything." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Swordbreaker - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Swordbreaker is interesting. It might take the place of the best lightweight frame shotgun. Being craftable, tying with the highest handling within its archetype, and being able to hit 100 range are just a few things that makes Swordbreaker interesting. You can choose a variety of different perks, you only need one handling perk and Threat Detector to hit 100 handling with an animation scalar, meaning you can invest the rest of your perks into range. Going with Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, and Opening Shot puts you at 91 range and 100 handling. Or you can opt for 100 range and 91 handling by swapping a few things around. The best part of this shotgun is its versatility." Recommended MW: Handling or Range.|tags:controller,pvp

I guess I thought there were more. Word of Crota is an interesting 180. If you crafted a good IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 then you won’t need this one. If you didn’t craft one, then this will be a great option. Subsistence as we know allows us to bypass the reload stat and your choice of damage perks will slot in perfectly. One combo to keep an eye on is the Repulsor Brace / Destabilizing Rounds combo.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus (Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking") has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool. If you haven't got one, then Arrowhead Brake improves handling and recoil direction, and Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum mag size of 5, and adds stability and reload speed. Overflow pushes you to an almost comical 11 in the mag on an ammo pickup, and Fighting Line boosts precision damage by 20% when you're close to at least two fireteam members - ideal for sustained damage phases against slow-moving or Divinity-debuffed bosses.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss.

First-choice PvE pick sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies, or burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Enhanced Explosive Light as the second column signature perk gives you 7 rockets with a 25% damage boost for the low, low costs of just picking up orbs - good for both burst and sustained damage.

I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon.

I know many vets who loved this auto and I can’t blame them. Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today’s world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus’s Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds.

Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back.

Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability.

In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(140) Arc Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "There aren’t a lot of hand cannons that see top tier usage in PvP. Opening Shot, Keep Away, and Perpetual Motion in one column, and Explosive Payload and Kill Clip in the other make for a stacked package. Add in enhanced perks and you have a recipe for a super solid hand cannon. Eye of the Storm or Fragile Focus would round out the mix for best perks on a hand cannon, but overall it’s a solid choice. Hard to say if this is stronger than Palindrome and Exalted Truth, but it certainly holds its own. You’ll have to fight some of the weird gun model though." |tags:pvp,controller

Arrowhead Brake with a CB mod brings the recoil to 100, so you can invest the rest of the fusion into range via Projection Fuse and Rangefinder. If you value kill chaining you could go for Reconstruction and Controlled Burst for never reloading and getting that 20% damage increase.

"In PvP you’re much better off using a different weapon as rapid-fire frames need two shots to reliably kill from a distance. If you are okay with that, then investing fully into handling and harmony for better damage after a kill would give you the best chance at competing with precision and aggressive frame shotguns." |tags:pvp,controller

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist (which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw), or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing.

If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. As at S21, A Distant Pull is the only non-raid kinetic rapid-fire sniper rifle.

Fluted Barrel and Tactical Mag fill out Handling, Stability, Reload Speed and also max out the magazine size to 7. Overflow is laughably good on a special weapon, as a first trait column support park, doubling the magazine size just for picking up an ammo brick, even when stowed.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Until Its Return has decent stats in comparison to other kinetic slot rapid-fire shotguns and some reliable trait combinations. Handling is the best thing to aim for with the barrel perk, but range and stability can be useful too. Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 8 rounds, so there's no point looking at Appended or Extended Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow is great for doubling the mag size for running over an ammo brick, or Auto-Loading Holster means you can rely on a full magazine every time you pull it out.

Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives.

In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in general content. Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives. However, it's the first hand cannon that can drop with Kinetic Tremors, so it might be worth keeping around in case a rework makes it a bit easier to proc. Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For general add clearing Subsistence in the first trait column as the support park keeps your magazine topped up as you get kills. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and Minor add-clearing in end-game content. If you haven't got an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, the Bug-Out Bag could be a very acceptable alternative. Decent stats but, if you get Threat Detector as a perk, you can pretty much ignore stability, handling and reload with your barrel choices, so you might as well control the recoil a little instead - Extended Barrel or Chambered Compensator take the Recoil Direction to a near-perfect 98. Any of the Combat Effect magazine perks adds utility, and a little range on top. In the first trait column as the support perk, Threat Detector at two stacks takes stability to around 80 and maxes out handling and reload speed and Incandescent as the second column signature perk is great for add clearing and builds into your scorch and ignite Solar verbs.

First-choice PvE pick for end-game use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell in the magazine add reload speed, stability and, for the former, an extra burst. Pair that with Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk, to make successive bursts easier to land and boost reload speed further. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers.

Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use).

Techeun Force (however Saint Kabr pronounces it...) is reprised in a new, highly desirable perk set. I say set, it's really just one perk in particular. The stats to start are pretty good, although the recoil direction needs some attention, so Arrowhead Brake will take that to a controllable 90. For a damage roll, Liquid Coils is the obvious choice - don't worry, we'll get around the charge time penalty later. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Rewind Rounds means you should be able to keep shooting until the battery is empty - you need a minimum of two shots in the mag to proc it, but then it reloads 2 shots from reserves. Finally, as the signature perk in the second trait slot, the new-for-S21 Controlled Burst drops your charge time by 10% and increases damage by 20% just for hitting all your bolts, making this great for burst and sustained damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Enhanced Battery then takes you to the maximum battery size. If you've not already got an arc-based Golden Tricorn fusion rifle, then look for Rewind Rounds, Reconstruction or Envious Assassin in the first trait slot as your support perk, to help with your uptime, and then Golden Tricorn is great for a reliable 15% refreshable damage bump up that goes up to a chunky 50% with an arc ability kill.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well). Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and bosses with short damage windows in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For a guided rocket, you want to velocity as low as possible, to give the shot plenty of time for course correction if your target jinks, and Confined Launch is the barrel to do that. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column Tracking Module is very useful for hitting more mobile majors and bosses, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage. The Dream Works origin trait is useful in a fireteam to get the occasional overflowed magazine in a firefight too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For the magazine perk, any of the "Rounds" mags or Flared Magwell work well. For your first trait column support perk, Rapid Hit and Perpetual Motion can both layer on addition gunfeel boosts on top. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Finally, in the second slot, the new-for-Lightfall Kinetic Tremors as the signature perk adds bonus AoE damage for 12 hits (or four bursts), damaging your target and any adds within 5m.

First-choice PvE pick for chunky add-clear use in endgame activities. The stats on Unexpected Resurgence make it the best adaptive glaive in the sandbox as at Season 21. Every Haft choice involves a trade-off but for most, the improved shield from Auxiliary Reserves, or maybe the range (which = projectile speed) from Supercooled Accelerator, are worth the penalty to reload speed, which we can get around. In the mag, Appended Mag for the extra shot (Extended doesn't do anything more for you), or Accurized Rounds for the range are options, and if reload speed is still a worry, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out. In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, and Unstoppable Force as the second column signature perk is a natural pairing, boosting damage by 20% for blocking the same damage with your shield.

Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons."

Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw.

I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don’t have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are “maining” this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don’t love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don’t use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Adaptive(120) Void Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "In PvP there are not a lot of interesting rolls for grenade launchers. You can roll Proximity Grenades for really reliable OHKs. Rangefinder makes the trajectory faster and Disruption Break can also help if you splash someone instead of getting that OHK, swapping to your kinetic for a 50 percent damage bonus. This can also help in 6s as any of your teammates get the 50 percent damage bonus after you break their shield. Helpful if you can coordinate with your team but also a nice bonus if you get it going." |tags:pvp,controller

"In PvE Subsistence with Golden Tricorn will be your bread and butter for never ending shooting and a huge damage buff. This works with a build that ability loops by itself like Heart of Inmost Light. If you can keep up Golden Tricorn 2x constantly you will have an incredibly high damage hand cannon. Envious Assassin is an interesting perk as you’ll need to swap off your primary to get kills to overflow your magazine to swap back to your primary. If you are running double primary weapons in higher end content or just like to switch up weapons for clearing rooms you will love this perk. However, I just find it odd to need to swap off your primary to overflow your primary." |tags:pvp,controller

Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well.

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag. As the support perk, in the first trait column, Feeding Frenzy boosts reload speed further after kills - your solar ignition kills from Incandescent will add to the stacks, particularly when paired with Ember of Ashes.

Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. This is one of the first ARs with Target Lock, so if you choose that as your second trait column signature perk to build towards, Alloy Mag makes a lot of sense as the magazine perk - you need to be firing continuously until the mag is empty to build damage stacks. Although generally more of a PvP perk, Zen Moment as the support perk helps with the lowish stability to keep shots on target for Target Lock's stacking damage boost.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling (and boost reload speed too). Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL.

This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest). As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support park in the first trait column, Relentless Strikes don't require a kill to return ammo, so is best for chunkier adds and Majors, although Flash Counter's weaken effect is also worth considering. Majors are usually accompanied by Minor adds, so Surrounded (especially when enhanced) or One for All as signature perks in the second trait column both work well.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Precision frame SMG, so you don't have to worry about recoil direction and range is pretty compressed, so go for handling and stability with your barrel. In the mag, High-Caliber Rounds is always good for extra flinch on a bullet hose, but Armor-Piercing is also decent for damaging multiple adds in CQC, Ricochet Rounds can be run or just get extra stability and Reload speed with Flared Magwell. There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column - Envious Assassin is much better on a Special or Power weapon, but it's worth it for the occasional overfilled mag. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on rapid kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8. In the second trait column, Explosive Payload adds a flat 15% bonus damage or, in a fireteam, Firing Line adds 20% crit damage.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats (so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time). Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The first Strand flavoured LMG as at v7.0.0.3 but unfortunately stats are low by comparison with other adaptive frames - but there's still a choice of very usable rolls. Chambered Compensator takes the recoil direction to a controllable 90 and adds some extra stability. If you're using this for add clear, any one of the combat effect rounds (High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing or Ricochet Rounds) will work in the mag, then a reload park like Feeding Frenzy, maybe Keep Away if you're not up to your neck in CQC adds, Pulse Monitor to refill the magazine when your shield's broken, or Envious Assassin to overfill the magazine before you start, should work nicely. In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major.

Even though match game is less of an issue from Season 20, you can take advantage of any ability verbs from the grenade you throw - so, for example, a void grenade can proc Volatile Rounds which your now void energy Lodbrok will apply. Unfortunately Demolitionist rolls in the same trait column, but Adrenaline Junkie will trigger on a grenade kill for 33% boost to damage on top in the second column instead.

Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds.

Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds.

You want your rocket to go where you’re shooting so either impulse amplifier for the zoom or tracking module to ensure it gets to where it should be. Then you want to make sure your one rocket counts so you choose chain reaction or cluster bomb. There really isn’t a lot to think about when it comes to PvP rockets."

// Wendigo GL3 (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

[...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible.

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am always both happy and sad when this weapon rolls around. Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It’s a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS."

Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. [...] On Controller I would recommend tap the trigger for even more stability.

This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or boost stability with your barrel perk. Add your choice of extra shots, stability and reload speed with the mag. For end-game add clear, use Stats for All, Field Prep, or Feeding Frenzy for maximum uptime in your first trait column, and the reliable Frenzy in the second for an easy to use 15% damage boost.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game boss DPS. Shapeable. Veist Stinger is the origin trait to use, as it procs per shot rather than per burst, which means you'll probably never need to reload. F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser. Being a stasis LFR, it's easy to get a Font of Might 25% boost to your damage if you have a Warlock putting down a Well and willing to use the Supreme Wellmaker mod, and you're using the Elemental Shards and Elemental Time Dilation mods. You'll need to keep your shots on a boss's crit spot, so maximise your stability with your barrel, and then add in an extra charge with no downsides with Enhanced Battery. For major or boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves (which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger). Frenzy is an easily procced 15% damage boost just for being in combat, or Vorpal Weapon is an uncomplicated 10% boost against Majors and Bosses.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation.

In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone".

Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,controller

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For kill-chaining, Swashbuckler x5 after a melee kill reduces TTK to 0.67 (4c, 2b), while Pugilist turns this into a legendary "Monte Carlo-lite", recovering melee ability energy to repeat the cycle.

// Jurassic Green (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Ricochet Rounds, Rangefinder, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b). Recommended MW: Stability, with a Counterbalance mod.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly with a solar subclass. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Golden Tricorn x1 or Radiant get you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies, and if you can get Golden Tricorn x2 up (and have enough battery charge left), you can get an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.53s with 5 crits and 4 bodies. Choose a barrel that doesn't have any penalties and Tactical Battery provides a range of small gunfeel stat boosts.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// Out of Bounds (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), Dynamic Sway Reducation, Tap the Trigger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. For a duelling roll, it's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column - pair this with the Omolon origin trait and Tap the Trigger and you'll end up with a precision bullet hose no matter where you are in the magazine.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “In PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane).

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference.

// Roar of the Bear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I wish legendary rocket launchers had more identities over just damage or single use boom sticks. Roar of the Bear is no exception to this rule. You can either set it up for maximum damage via field prep or demolitionist, paired with lasting impression, or vorpal weapon. OR set it up with chain reaction or incandescent and impulse amplifier so the boom gets there quicker. There really is not anything interesting or new with rockets, so keep on going for the usual.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “PvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I do not see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.

Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for in end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. The only High-Impact Stasis LMG available as at v6.2.0.6, but comparing to other HIs, the stats are a mixed bunch. It's slow-firing, so you should be able to control the recoil with extra stability from the barrel choice. Go all-in for mag size with Extended Mag to boost the benefits from the origin perk to get you close to 100 shots without reloading. Stats for All helps with gunfell and for when you finally do need to reload, but the real joy is in the Swiss-Army knife benefits of Killing Tally - three kills gets you a 30% damage buff with no time limit for the rest of the (huge) magazine or until stowed - better than either Firing Line or Focused Fury can offer - good for ripping through Minor adds, burst damage against Majors or even sustained damage against Bosses.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

Boost damage with the Blade and Swordmaster's Guard boosts the charge rate for heavy attacks. Then Relentless Strikes helps with ammo economy or Relentless triggers health regeneration in a crowd, and Chain Reaction is a tonne of fun while clearing adds.

Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer’s tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap.

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Where I’ve heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura’s Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid.

Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 22. PvE first-choice roll for Stasis subclasses in general add clear. The Veist origin trait can occasionally help with faster draw time and, although it has the best-in-slot stats in the Lightweight bow subtype (but it's still a Lightweight, so meh), it lacks Archer's Tempo as a trait. As ever, look for the fastest draw time with Elastic String and then recover the accuracy with Straight Fletching or Fiberglass Arrow Shaft. Headstone is always a useful perk for Stasis subclasses, and Rangefinder (for better accuracy), Shoot to Loot, or No Distractions are probably your best pairings.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Compulsive reloader has its best use when paired with reservoir burst to maximize uptime on that larger damage. Couple that with last season’s particle deconstruction and chefs kiss. Unfortunately we can only work with the seasonal mods we have now, so Snorri-FR5 falls off considerably, but still has great utility in double special weapons builds as the primary form of add-clear. Pair this with another special weapon that does good single target damage and you have yourself a build (heavy weapon optional)." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind. You could definitely opt for some of the other perks here too as nothing really screams PvE."|tags:pve,controller

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "For PvP I really value Rangefinder. It would give it the competitive edge over guns like Thorn or Ace and increase Hawkmoon’s already stellar consistency. If you don’t like the increased Zoom then something like Snapshot Sights really makes Hawkmoon feel snappy. You also can’t go wrong with Eye of the Storm, Opening Shot, or Killing Wind."|tags:pvp,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."

// False Promises
//notes: (PvP / Controller): Mercules904 (pretty good PvP/controller) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pvp,controller
