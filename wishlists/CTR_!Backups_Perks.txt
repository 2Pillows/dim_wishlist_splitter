// Exalted Truth - PvE Minors god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag), (Destabilizing Rounds), (Repulsor Brake, Demoralize)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 133 from 11 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/49VFDRj05iDXTJDOBqQpga?si=e61731a19fb64938) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor add groups in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content, particularly with void builds. Exalted Truth returns with a perk refresh and provides quite a convincing argument for popping into Trials to get some useful PvE rolls. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 50 Range and 14 Zoom equate to 30.75m ADS and 20.50m hipfire, 58 Stability is ×1.1641 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.61s reload, Recoil Direction is 95, and base magazine size is 11 (max 14). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, and then the magazine perk can round out Reload Speed and/or bump up magazine size. For void builds, Destabilizing Rounds is in the first trait perk column, spreading volatility and proccing volatile rounds for clearing add crowds which you can combine in the second column with Repulsor Brace for a void overshield, or Demoralize to provide an effective ×1.18 damage boost to nearby enemies by spreading void weaken. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health, or if you're soloing content, Alacrity provides excellent gunfeel boosts: +20 to Range and Stability, +50 to Reload Speed and +10 to Aim Assist. Recommended MW: Handling with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

The refreshed loot pool offers a combination of Explosive Payload for an ×1.1 damage bonus to crits and ×1.15 to body shots together with Desperate Measures for an up to ×1.3 multiplier for 7s for weapon and ability kills (which stacks with Explosive Payload). Wild Card is the most fun of the origin traits, dropping Telesto-like "experimental submunitions" on kills.

Joxer's Longsword is only the second non-endgame Heavy Burst frame pulse rifle - it's a Crucible weapon so if you're focussing with Shaxx reset your reputation as many times as you can to get as many options as possible in the two trait perk columns. At base, the stats are on the low side by comparison with its end-game peers, but in-band when compared to Corrasion - 74 Range and 18 Zoom equate to 38.79m ADS and 21.55m hipfire, 33 Stability is ×1.1292 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 36 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.39s ADS and 0.42s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 2.18s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. Base magazine size is 30. Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, and then any of the combat effect magazine perks or something to help with the slow reload speed. In the first trait perk column, for end-game use, Shoot to Loot is always a good option, picking up power orbs and ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons. To match with that, One For All boosts damage by ×1.35 for 10s for just hitting three enemies, or for dealing with add crowds, Destabilizing Rounds spreads volatility and procs volatile rounds, or Demoralize spreads Weaken on a crit kill, effectively boosting damage to nearby enemies by ×1.18. Of the three origin traits, One Quiet Moment is probably the most useful for PvE, boosting Handling by +20 and Reload Speed by +40 with a ×0.95 animation duration after 5s of not dealing or receiving damage, or and 1.5s after you get a kill but if you're trying to hit crits, Nadir Focus boosts range by up to +10 and up to ×1.075 increased accuracy cone size as you fire. If you're interested, Joxer is a character from the "Xena: Warrior Princess" TV series. Recommended MW: Handling with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Void Breaches or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

The stats are pretty balanced, so you can boost Range, Stability, Handling and/or Reload Speed with the barrel and magazine perks, to your preference. For stasis builds, the trait perk combination of Rimestealer and Headstone generates Frost Armor stacks from freezing enemies and shattering the Stasis crystals for AoE damage from Headstone.

The stats are pretty balanced, so you can boost Range, Stability, Handling and/or Reload Speed with the barrel and magazine perks, to your preference. For a good, all-purpose roll for general use, Demolitionist in the first trait perk column is great for utility. To pair with theat in the second, Desperate Measures boosts damage by up to ×1.3 for 7s by combining weapon and ability kills, Sword Logic is pretty easy to keep a stack or two of damage bonus by killing increasingly tanky enemies (although getting to the fourth stack of ×1.5 damage after killing a boss is difficult to pull off and maybe of limited use if that's the end of an encounter), or Headstone provides AoE damage when you break the Stasis crystal after a crit kill.

Resounding is only the second version of the Aggressive Frame fusion rifle subfamily, and the first in the kinetic slot, firing three horizontal bursts of four bolts in a gradually widening spread. At base, the stats are in-band by comparison with its peers - 35 Range and 15 Zoom equate to 21.35m ADS and 16.43m hipfire, 57 Stability is ×1.1416 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 28 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 32 Reload Speed is a 2.26s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. Base battery size is 6 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 20/23/26/28 (max 28). Barrel and magazine perks are fixed - Smallbore and Particle Repeater providing a smidge more Range and Stability. The most useful trait combination is Subsistence, with kills refilling the magazine, to maintain Reservoir Burst's ×1.25 damage boost and AoE explosion on a kill when the battery is full (or nrealy full when enhanced). Of the three origin traits, One Quiet Moment is probably the most useful for PvE, boosting Handling by +20 and Reload Speed by +40 with a ×0.95 animation duration after 5s of not dealing or receiving damage, or and 1.5s after you get a kill. Recommended MW: Reload Speed with a Quick Access Sling mod (Backup Mag tanks your reserves, so avoid) or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Strand Tangles or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

Backfang is the first Rapid-Fire glaive that you can use in the kinetic slot, for any glaive aficionados but, if you're after a roll. remember to reset your Gambit reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 43 Range and equates to 17.35 ADS and a velocity of 100.36m/s, Shield Duration of 27 is 9.62s when fully charged, 71 Handling is 0.27s ready and 0.31s stow speed, 70 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload (1.82s when reloading form an empty mag with the frame intrinsic), and base magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 36/40/44/44 (max 44). The one stat that's noticably poor is Range, so use the barrel perk to improve that, or you can extend Shield Duration if you playstyle involves blocking damage. For the magazine perk, again look to boost Range and/or Reload Speed. There are a fair few potential first trait perk column options for PvE - for a glaive melee playstyle, the combination of Grave Robber to refill your magazine on a melee or elemental ability melee hit, with Close to Melee for a ×1.3 melee damage boost for 10s after a projectile kill is a natual pairing or, alternatively in the first trait perk column, Field Prep boosts ammo reserves as well as Reload Speed and ready/stow speed when crouched, Lead From Gold is great for overall ammo economy, or Impulse Amplifier passively boosts Velocity and Reload Speed. Gun and Run is a decent origin trait for a melee playstyle, granting a ×1.0625 sprint speed boost for 10s for killing a Major or better or three Minors within 10s. Recommended MW: Range with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy for Strand Tangles or when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 40/43/47/49 (max 55). The one stat that's noticably poor is Velocity, so use the barrel perk to improve that, with either Tactical Mag for a few useful stat bumps or High-Veloity Rounds to further boost Velocity as the magazine perk. For void builds, the fan favourite combination of Repulsor Brace in the firt trait perk column and Destabilizing Rounds in the second provides Void Overshields on void-debuffed kills which you'll get easily with Destabilizing rounds spreading Volatility and proccing Volatile Rounds to clear add groups. Vanguard's Vindication is a better-then-nothing origin trait, returning 10HP on a kill. If there's a champion mod, then Stunning Recovery is great to trigger health regeneration on a champion.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 133 from 11 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/49VFDRj05iDXTJDOBqQpga?si=e61731a19fb64938) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing group of Minor adds in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content, particularly with void builds. Lotus-Eater finishes the family of rocket sidearms, providing a void version for the energy slot. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 34 Velocity and 18 Zoom equates to 13.20m ADS and 11.00m hipfire (although damage drop-off is quite shallow), 47 Stability is ×1.1607 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 47 Handling is 0.30s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 55 Reload Speed is a 1.53s reload, Recoil Direction is 89, and base magazine size is 11 (max 18). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 40/43/47/49 (max 55). The one stat that's noticably poor is Velocity, so use the barrel perk to improve that, with either Tactical Mag for a few useful stat bumps or High-Veloity Rounds to further boost Velocity as the magazine perk. For an all-purpose roll, in the first trait perk column, Beacon Rounds' homing shots is great to maintain shots on target under pressure, while you can clear groups of Minor adds quickly with Destabilizing Rounds, spreading volatility and proccing Volatile Rounds, or deal with more hefty enemies through One for All's ×1.35 damage bonus for 10s for hitting three enemies. Vanguard's Vindication is a better-then-nothing origin trait, returning 10HP on a kill. If there's a champion mod, then Stunning Recovery is great to trigger health regeneration on a champion. Recommended MW: Velocity with an Adept Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy for Void Breaches or when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

First thing to say is that Keen Thistle, while a decent sniper rifle, is an aggressive frame and so not currently a meta pick for DPS. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 77 Range and 35 Zoom (so a much more open sight than usual), 31 Stability is ×1.1124 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 31 Handling is 0.43s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.37s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 3.15s reload, Recoil Direction is 75, and base magazine size is 3 (max 5). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 24/26/27/27 (max 27). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling, and then the magazine perk to increase magazine size to the max of 5 with Backup Mag. If you do want to keep a roll for boss damage, in case of a future buff, then the combination of Envious Arsenal (when enhanced, that counts as a extra reserve mod too) and Bait and Switch, as part of a weapon rotation, refills all your weapons and boosts damage by ×1.3 for 10s (11s with enhanced B+S), or Vorpal Weapon for an always-on ×1.15 damage against Majors and Bosses. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health, or if you're soloing content, Alacrity provides excellent gunfeel boosts: +20 to Range and Stability, +50 to Reload Speed and +10 to Aim Assist.

There are a few legendary adaptive frame trace rifles available now, and Warlord's Spear is not a bad arc variant. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 67 Range and 16 Zoom equate to 34.51m ADS and 21.57m hipfire, 76 Stability is ×1.2575 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 2.01s reload and Recoil Direction is 93. Base magazine size is 97 (Max 104) and, with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 525/575/626/641 (max 687). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling (M+KB) or Stability (Controller), and then either a battery perk to boost capacity or Stability or something to help with reload speed. In the first trait perk column, Rewind Rounds is probably the pick of the utility perks, although Envious Assassin or Loose Change are very decent alternatives. For arc builds, Jolting Feedback is great to apply Jolt for both single target damage and add clearing, proccing after 18 hits (17 when the perk's enhanced and 13 when amplified), to synergise with arc fragments. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health.

It's been a few seasons since the last new adaptive frame rocket launcher, but Cynosure brings that wait to an end. If you're after a roll, remember to reset your Vanguard reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 54 Velocity equates to 36.02m/s, 44 Stability is ×1.1270 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 41 Handling is 0.50s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.41s stow speed, and 39 Reload Speed is a 3.27s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 8/9/10/11 (max 11). You can boost Handling and/or Velocity with the barrel and magazine perks, or use Impact Casing to boost overall damage by ×1.022. I you don't have a rocket launcher roll for boss damage then in the first trait perk column, Overflow or Reconstruction both overflow the magazine to front-load a damage phase, or Field Prep provides the equivalent of a reserve mod (2 when enhanced) and boosts Reload Speed and ready/stow speed. In the second column, Explosive Light provides an easy ×1.25 damage boost for six shots (7 when enhanced) for just picking up power orbs. If you're interested, "Cynosure" could be something or someone at the centre of attention, someone who directs or guides, or the Ursa Major constellation - take your pick! Suros Synergy is the more useful origin trait, providing +40 Handling and ×1.2 flinch resistance for 6s after a reload.

It might look a little old-fashioned now, but it you're new to Destiny and haven't already got a pulse rifle with Demolitionist or Pugilist in the first trait perk column and Desperate Measures in the second, they're a natural pairing, boosting damage by up to ×1.3 for 7s by combining weapon and ability kills, while regaining either grenade or melee energy on weapon kills. Of the three origin traits, One Quiet Moment is probably the most useful for PvE, boosting Handling by +20 and Reload Speed by +40 with a ×0.95 animation duration after 5s of not dealing or receiving damage, or and 1.5s after you get a kill but if you're trying to hit crits, Nadir Focus boosts range by up to +10 and up to ×1.075 increased accuracy cone size as you fire.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.5.2.1 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec M+KB Controller): Backup PvE pick for dealing with Majors in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content. Backfang is the first Rapid-Fire glaive that you can use in the kinetic slot, for any glaive aficionados but, if you're after a roll. remember to reset your Gambit reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 43 Range and equates to 17.35 ADS and a velocity of 100.36m/s, Shield Duration of 27 is 9.62s when fully charged, 71 Handling is 0.27s ready and 0.31s stow speed, 70 Reload Speed is a 2.27s reload (1.82s when reloading form an empty mag with the frame intrinsic), and base magazine size is 6 (max 8). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 36/40/44/44 (max 44). The one stat that's noticably poor is Range, so use the barrel perk to improve that, or you can extend Shield Duration if you playstyle involves blocking damage. For the magazine perk, again look to boost Range and/or Reload Speed. There are a fair few potential first trait perk column options for PvE - if you're using the glaive shield regularly, the combination of Replenishing Aegis to refill your mag when blocking damage, or Immovable Object for increased energy when you're stationery and blocking, together with Unstoppable Force for a ×1.2 boost to bolt damage while shielding is a natural pairing. Alternatively, in the first trait perk column, Field Prep boosts ammo reserves as well as Reload Speed and ready/stow speed when crouched, Lead From Gold is great for overall ammo economy, or Impulse Amplifier passively boosts Velocity and Reload Speed. Gun and Run is a decent origin trait for a melee playstyle, granting a ×1.0625 sprint speed boost for 10s for killing a Major or better or three Minors within 10s. Recommended MW: Range with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy for Strand Tangles or when the champion mod's on the seasonal artifact, Stunloader.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.5.2.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor add groups in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content. There are a few legendary adaptive frame trace rifles available now, and Warlord's Spear is not a bad arc variant. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 67 Range and 16 Zoom equate to 34.51m ADS and 21.57m hipfire, 76 Stability is ×1.2575 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.37s ready, 0.29s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, 33 Reload Speed is a 2.01s reload and Recoil Direction is 93. Base magazine size is 97 (Max 104) and, with 0/1//3 reserves mods, total ammo is 525/575/626/641 (max 687). Use the barrel perk to improve Handling (M+KB) or Stability (Controller), and then either a battery perk to boost Reload Speed or something to help with Stability. The first trait perk column standout Rewind Rounds is a decent alternative to extend your magazine and reduce the need to reload, although Envious Assassin can overfill your battery with kills from other weapons. In the second column, Killing Tally increases damage up to ×1.3 after three kills, until you reload or stow. The reworked Skulking Wolf origin trait can be useful in PvE, making enemies less accurate when firing at you for 10s after getting a kill while at low health.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.5.2.1 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-God PvE-EndGame M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content. It's been a few seasons since the last new adaptive frame rocket launcher, but Cynosure brings that wait to an end. If you're after a roll, remember to reset your Vanguard reputation as many times as you're able, to maximise your chances from the 12×12 trait perk options. At base, the stats are okay by comparison with its peers - 54 Velocity equates to 36.02m/s, 44 Stability is ×1.1270 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 41 Handling is 0.50s ready, 0.44s ADS and 0.41s stow speed, and 39 Reload Speed is a 3.27s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 8/9/10/11 (max 11). You can boost Handling and/or Velocity with the barrel and magazine perks, or use Impact Casing to boost overall damage by ×1.022. I you don't have a rocket launcher roll for boss damage then in the first trait perk column, Overflow or Reconstruction both overflow the magazine to front-load a damage phase, or Field Prep provides the equivalent of a reserve mod (2 when enhanced) and boosts Reload Speed and ready/stow speed. In the second column, Lasting Impression provides a setup-free ×1.194 damage boost for every shot, if you can wait 3s for a seperate explosion (so stop shooting 3s before the damage phase ends). If you're interested, "Cynosure" could be something or someone at the centre of attention, someone who directs or guides, or the Ursa Major constellation - take your pick! Suros Synergy is the more useful origin trait, providing +40 Handling and ×1.2 flinch resistance for 6s after a reload.

Use the barrel perk help control the recoil or add Handling if you're on M+KB, and then the magazine perk can round out Reload Speed and/or bump up magazine size. In the first trait perk column, Enlightened Action stacks boost Handling and Reload Speed by up to +50 on weapon hits, or Fourth Time's the Charm extends your magazine on crit hits. As the second column damage trait perk, Explosive Payload boosts crit damage by ×1.1 and bodyshot damage by ×1.15 as well as flinching enemies, or High Ground either provides escalating damage on kills up to ×1.25, or ×1.25 damage for your feet being 2m or more higher then an enemy's lowest point.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 133 from 18 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4NmtGbfgA5USVGjtqEcqps?si=17c11135a8cb4f39) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor add groups in both general at-level or better, and end-game underlevelled content. Keraunios is the third legendary arc trace rifle in game, and the second dropping during Episode: Heresy. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 68 Range and 16 Zoom equate to 34.67m ADS and 21.67m hipfire, 75 Stability is ×1.2547 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 49 Handling is 0.38s ready, 0.30s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 48 Reload Speed is a 2.02s reload, Recoil Direction is 100, and base magazine size is 98 (max 104). With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 505/556/607/632 (max 671). Use the barrel perk to bump up the low Handling, and then the magazine perk can boost magazing size or add a little extra handling. In the first trait perk column, Overload is the standout option, overflowing the battery by ×2 (×2.2 when enchanced) just for picking up an ammo brick. As a damage perk, Detonator Beam is very strong, providing a wide AoE detonation that's like a heavy weapon Chain Reaction on steroids, and about twice the damage Firefly and Dragonfly for landing about 25 shots (around 20 when enhanced), to wipe out groups of adds around your target, or Killing Tally provides a ×1.3 damage boost after three kills for as long as you don't reload or stow. If you're interested,the name is derived from the ancient Greek "κεραυνός" - a lightning bolt or thunderbolt. Classy Contender is an unspectacular origin trait, generating roughly 5% class ability energy on kills. Recommended MW: Handling with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

In the first trait perk column, Overload is the standout option, overflowing the battery by ×2 (×2.2 when enchanced) just for picking up an ammo brick, but Eddy Current isn't a bad alternative for an arc build, adding +20 to Reload Speed (+60 when Amplified) as well as ×0.95 reload and handling animation. To synergise with arc builds, Jolting Feedback is great to apply Jolt for both single target damage and add clearing, proccing after 18 hits (17 when the perk's enhanced and 13 when amplified), or Rolling Storm to generate 1 stack (2 when enhanced) of Bolt Charge on kills.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 25/27/28/29 (max 31). Use the barrel perk to bump up the Blast Radius, to widen the wave or, if you're swapping a lot look to boost Handling. For a boss roll against Bosses with multiple bodies, such as Raneiks Unified from the Vesper's Host dungeon, Field Prep provides a reserves mod worth of total ammo (2 when enhanced), and +50 Reload Speed (+55 when enhanced) and ×0.8 reload and handling animations when crouched. Alternatively, Envious Assassin can overload your magazine by as much as ×3, or you can bypass reload with Envious Arsenal.

The Title returns for 2025 having lost Attrition Orbs as a trait perk but gaining a few other tricks. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 40 Range and 15 Zoom equate to 18.06m ADS and 12.90m hipfire, 20 Stability is ×1.1000 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 48 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.27s ADS and 0.33s stow speed, 23 Reload Speed is a 2.22s reload, Recoil Direction is 85, and base magazine size is 32 (max 39). Aggressives could to with a bit more Stability (Controller) or Handling (M+KB), or both from your barrel perk, and then any of the combat effect magazine perks work well on a bullet hose, or look to improve Reload Speed. For melee builds, Grave Robber provides an instant magazine refill on a melee kill, or Recycled Energy grants energy to your lowest charged ability on weapon kills, both of which can work well with Swashbuckler in the second column for a damage boost of up to ×1.33 for 6.5s (8.5s when enhanced).

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Where Peacebond does belong is over in the Crucible of Iron Osiris. Or something like that. Zen Moment really keeps that reticle bounce down and makes the third bullet less jumpy. Kill Clip allows you to immediately follow up as most sidearm magazines are pretty small, and the burst chews through ammo. If you're opting for a more neutral sidearm for Trials, competitive, or rumble then you should look for Lone Wolf or Rangefinder to really push out some stats or your range. Headseeker is great neutrally but you can't go wrong with Desperate Measures either." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Elemental Capacitor will boost your already high stats as nothing was gained or lost from the old version. Explosive Payload is fine for extra flinch but you lose a touch of range. Opening Shot is the easiest to recommend as it's always good. Snapshot Sights is also good neutrally. Magnificent Howl, Desperate Measures, or Master of Arms will all slightly adjust your damage. Magnificent Howl is the only guaranteed way to two-tap, but Desperate Measures and Master of Arms will both adjust your ease of use but none really shift the needle outside of needing one less crit.

// The Palindrome (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The stomping grounds for Palindrome was always the Crucible, why it got relegated to nightfalls is beyond me. Elemental Capacitor will boost your already high stats as nothing was gained or lost from the old version. Explosive Payload is fine for extra flinch but you lose a touch of range. Opening Shot is the easiest to recommend as it's always good. Snapshot Sights is also good neutrally. Magnificent Howl, Desperate Measures, or Master of Arms will all slightly adjust your damage. Magnificent Howl is the only guaranteed way to two-tap, but Desperate Measures and Master of Arms will both adjust your ease of use but none really shift the needle outside of needing one less crit. And it's also not guaranteed because depending on resilience you may need 2 stacks of either to kill all resiliences for 2c1b." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for use against Minor add groups in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. Fan favourite Fatebringer is still worth a look if you're looking for a strong kinetic slot primary which by default as a kinetic weapon, does ×1.1 damage against Minor adds. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers (particularly if you ignore the stat monster that is Midnight Coup) - 46 Range and 14 Zoom equates to 30.21m ADS and 20.14m hipfire, 57 Stability is ×1.1624 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 55 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.24s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, 46 Reload Speed is a 2.63s reload and Recoil Direction is 98. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Stability and Range, and Alloy Mag is the pick of the magazine perks, with an up to ×0.8 scalar to Reload Speed. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - Kinetic Tremors procs after 6 hits (5 when enhanced) for additional target and AoE damage or Explosive Payload adds damage (×1.1 to crit and ×1.15 to body) and flinch. Both pair well with One For All - both helping proc the ×1.35 damage boost for hitting 3 enemies, and both inheriting the boost to their own damage. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create power orbs or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

Unfortunately, while Vision of Confluence is a solid scout rifle, it's in the subfamily with the lowest damage output and there are other options which offer much the same set of perks. At base, the stats are decent by comparison with its peers - 46 Range and 20 Zoom equates to 74.93m ADS and 37.46m hipfire, 42 Stability is ×1.1495 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, 47 Reload Speed is a 2.04s reload and Recoil Direction is 75 (but with the Precision frame intrinsic, you can pretty much ignore the RD stat). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help out a little with Reload Speed and Stability. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - this is the only primary that can roll with Incandescent, with kills spreading scorch and AoE damage. Any ignition kills will proc Paracausal Affinity's ×1.2 damage boost, making this a natural pairing, but Frenzy for ×1.15 damage and maxxed Handling and Reload Speed, or Explosive Payload for ×1.1 crit and ×1.15 bodyshot damage and Firefly for a solar AoE detonation and +50 Reload Speed will also help spread scorch damage over a wider area, to help even more with add clearing.

// Found Verdict (Timelost) - PvE majors god 3
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling), (Assault Mag, Tactical mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag), (Threat Detector, Threat Remover), Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major adds in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. While it's no longer the shotgun behemoth it was, Found Verdict still might find a place in a loadout, particularly if you're newer and are still looking for options to deal with Elites, Champions and Minibosses. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 31 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 4.68m, 22 Stability is ×1.1022 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 39 Handling is 0.41s ready, 0.36s ADS and 0.44s stow speed, 36 Reload Speed is a 0.82s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 75. Base magazine size is 4 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 20/22/24/25 (max 25). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, while as the magazine perk Assault Mag improves DPS, Tactical Mag and Appended Mag improve the magazine size, or Light Mag improves Reload Speed. For a burst damage roll, the first trait perk column offers useful utility reload perks - both Threat Detector and Threat Remover improves handling and reload speed when procced. All of those work well with Voltshot, jolting targets for additional target and AoE damage, and synergising with arc build fragments. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves. Recommended MW: Handling, with an Adept Backup Mag mod or, when fully enhanced, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

// Praedyth's Revenge - PvE Bosses god 1

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Bosses in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. The combination of trait perks and the Timelost Magazine origin trait make Praedyth's Revenge a serious option for a boss special weapon when using a heavy that does damage over time. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 34 Range and 49 Zoom, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow speed, 63 Reload Speed is a 2.65s reload (2.12s with the Rapid-Fire frame intrinsic when reloading from an empty magazine) and Recoil Direction is 55. Base magazine size is 6 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 30/32/35/35 (max 35). You'll need to keep hitting crits, so use the barrel perk to improve the Recoil Direction, or add Stability. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 shots to make the most of the origin trait, or look to just increase Stability or Reload Speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag. Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column gives you the option for double damage perks and AoE damage (after 3 hits, or 2 when enhanced), but remember it can only proc on a target once, so it only makes sense for one Guardian in a fireteam to be using it. The second column offers a traditional Bait and Switch for ×1.3 damage for rotating through your weapons or Elemantal Honing for up to ×1.4 damage if you can cycle through five different elemental damage types - both of these multipliers also affect Kinetic tremors damage too. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for boss damage phases. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod in you aren't at 7 shots in the mag or Quick Access Sling if you are, or when fully enhanced possibly an Anti-Flinch or Tactical Mod.

For a fun roll for add clearing, the void wombo combo of Destabilizing Rounds and Demoralize spreads volatility and procs Volatile Rounds for 4.5s as well as applying Weaken for a  ×1.15 damage boost for your whole fireteam, with both synergising well with void aspects and fragments.

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - PvE Majors god 1
// (Arrowhead Brake), (Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Tactical Mag), Redirection, (Killing Tally, One for All)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 131 from 5 March 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2TAB3PL2u2Qigv2YejzhGJ?si=09c3555ccf5c4dcc) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Elites, Champions and Minibosses in both general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content, particularly with void builds. Corrective Measure has returned with a rare frame change - from Adaptive to Aggressive - and is possibly now the strongest LMG in-game. At base, the stats are excellent by comparison with its peers - 47 Range and 15 Zoom equates to 47.28m ADS and 29.55m hipfire, 55 Stability is ×1.1787 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, 43 Reload Speed is a 4.97s reload and Recoil Direction is 85. Base magazine size is 59 (maximum 91), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 405/451/496/498 (max 601). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to boost mag size to take advantage of the origin trait. For burst damage, we have the reworked Redirection in the first column, which lets you build stacks up to 30, 3 at at time for Minor add kills, and use them 3 at a time for ×1.33 damage (2 at a time for ×1.5 when enhanced) against Majors and Bosses - so think of it as a way to bank an extra 10 or 15 shots of burst damage against against orange and yellow bar enemies enemies by killing adds. In the second column, you can add a second damage scalar with Killing Tally for up to ×1.3 damage as long as you don't reload or stow or One for All for ×1.35 damage for 10s if there are adds around to proc it. The Timelost Magazine origin trait is very strong for PvE - essentially, the Thresh trait perk for free to build your super quickly on kills, and then providing a ×2 magazine size for 20s after your super finishes, refilling the mag from your reserves, making it ideal for going on a killing spree.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help out a little with Reload Speed and Stability.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling and Velocity with Quick Launch, and Impact Casing as the magazine perk boosts overall damage by ×1.022. This is the only rocket launcher that can roll Overflow, appearing in the first trait perk column, which is ×2 magazine size for collecting any ammo brick (×2.2 when enhanced, rounded up for 3 in the tube). When you proc the origin trait, this takes this to 5 shots without reloading.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.2.0.2: PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in general at-level or better, and in end-game underleveled content. This Unvoiced roll looks like it could be an interesting choice for dealing with Champions and Minibosses that you encounter. At base, the stats are good by comparison with its peers - 70 Range and 12 Zoom equates to 9.40m ADS and 7.83m hipfire, 40 Stability is ×1.1225 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 75 Handling is 0.29s ready, 0.28s ADS and 0.32s stow speed, 49 Reload Speed is a 0.71s reload per shell and Recoil Direction is 55 (but you can ignore that with the precision frame intrinsic perk. Base mag size is 6 (max 8), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 19/21/23/24 (max 24). The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling while for the magazine perk, Assault Mag is the top choice to improve fire rate for better DPS, or add a shot or two to the mag. With the rework of Redirection, in the first trait column, this now lets you build stacks up to 30, 3 at at time for Minor add kills, and use them 3 at a time for ×1.33 damage (2 at a time for ×1.5 when enhanced) against Majors and Bosses - so think of it as a way to bank extra burst damage against against orange and yellow bar enemies enemies by killing adds. In the second column, Frenzy is active anyway when in combat, boosting damage by ×1.15 and maximising Handling and Reload Speed but then, when you face a tougher enemy, both perks combine to provide ×1.53 damage (×1.73 when enhanced) for bursting down Elites, Champions and Minibosses. The Subjugator origin trait is, frankly, nuts - against Minors and Majors it's an extra explosive rounds-style damage boosting perk that also adds flinch on every fourth shot that hits, while against Bosses it procs Exhaustion to reduce their outgoing damage by ×0.9.

Unloved is probably the best-in-kinetic-slot hand cannon as at the time of writing - not only is it the best DPS subfamily, being a heavy-burst frame, but the Subjugation origin trait is essentially a free extra damage perk.

The barrel perk can be used to improve the Handling, and the magazine perk can be used to help with Reload Speed or perhaps gain a few extra bullets. The first trait perk column offers the option for double damage perks - either Dragonfly for a Stasis AoE detonation on crit kills, or Hatchling to spawn a Threadling on crit kills or three rapid kills. In the second column, Frenzy provides ×1.15 damage, and maxes out Handling and Reload Speed just for being in combat or, Paracausal Affinity offers a ×1.2 damage boost for 6s for a Strand or Stasis final blow from any source.

Adamantite is the second support-frame AR in game, and the first equippable in the kinetic slot, which both heals allies, improves their damage and spawns unravelling projectiles, making it a good, fun weapon to use. At base, the stats are a bit low - 39 Range equates to 25.00m ADS and 15.63m hipfire, 49 Stability is ×1.1816 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.30s stow speed, 66 Reload Speed is a 1.58s reload and Recoil Direction is 52. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Recoil Direction or Stability on controller and handling on M+KB, and the magazine perk can be used to provide a bit more reload speed or extra rounds. The first trait perk column is strong for PvE, but the standout for endgame use is Reciprocity which provides you with healing without having to kill an enemy - 3HP for each hipfired bullet that connects with an ally to heal them. In the second column, pairing this with Circle of Life, for ×1.25 damage for 10s after rapidly healing an ally, Attrition Orbs to power armor mods or Frenzy for maxed Handling and Reload Speed stats and ×1.15 when in combat are all excellent choices.

In the second column, pairing this with Circle of Life, for ×1.25 damage for 10s after rapidly healing an ally, Attrition Orbs to power armor mods or Frenzy for maxed Handling and Reload Speed stats and ×1.15 when in combat are all excellent choices. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, overflowing your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Strand Tangles or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.

// Adamantite (Adept) - Endgame God
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Accurized Rounds), Reciprocity, (Circle of Life, Attrition Orbs, Frenzy)
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 129 from 4 February 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/19eFPPXbMv7cC0w8kJ234H?si=d61c9144b9aa4974) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for healing utility and use against Minor adds in general, and end-game underleveled content. Adamantite is the second support-frame AR in game, and the first equippable in the kinetic slot, which both heals allies, improves their damage and spawns unravelling projectiles, making it a good, fun weapon to use. At base, the stats are a bit low - 39 Range equates to 25.00m ADS and 15.63m hipfire, 49 Stability is ×1.1816 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 70 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.30s stow speed, 66 Reload Speed is a 1.58s reload and Recoil Direction is 52. The barrel perk can be used to improve the Recoil Direction or Stability on controller and handling on M+KB, and the magazine perk can be used to provide a bit more reload speed or extra rounds. The first trait perk column is strong for PvE, but the standout for endgame use is Reciprocity which provides you with healing without having to kill an enemy - 3HP for each hipfired bullet that connects with an ally to heal them. In the second column, pairing this with Circle of Life, for ×1.25 damage for 10s after rapidly healing an ally, Attrition Orbs to power armor mods or Frenzy for maxed Handling and Reload Speed stats and ×1.15 when in combat are all excellent choices.

Psychopomp adds an S-Tier arc option to the lineup of area denial frame grenade launchers. At base, the stats are in-band - at the time of writing, D2Foundry isn't showing the in-game stats, but hopefully they'll be added in soon. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 24/25/25/25 (max 25). Quick Launch as the barrel perk boosts both Handling and Velocity, and the High-Velocity Rounds magazine perk adds more Velocity with Reload Speed. In the first trait perk column, Ambitious Assassin overflows the magazine for two shots from a reload after a kill, as can the Runneth Over origin trait when you're with 15m of at least one other ally and, when the stars align, they can both proc for a physics-defying three in the tube. Alternatively, for melee builds, you gain 20% ability energy per kill from Pugilist. In the second column, Frenzy maxes out Handling and Reload Speed and boosts damage by ×1.15 just for being in combat. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, overflowing your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading.

Eyes Unveiled is a decent option if you don't already have a crafted Taipan but if you do, you can safely pass. At base, the stats are a bit low - 35 Range, 52 Stability is ×1.1360 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 25 Handling is 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.37s stow speed, 18 Reload Speed is a 2.53s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. The mag size is 5 (max 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 24/26/27/28 (max 28). Use the barrel perk to add Handling and help control recoil to land crits easier, while the battery perk can be used to increase magazine size or speed up Charge Time. For sustained damage, Overflow in the first trait column doubles the number of shots you for just picking up an ammo brick, bypassing reload altogether. In the second, Reservoir Burst boosts battery size further, applies ×1.25 damage on overflowed shots and creates an AoE detonation on a kill. Willing Vessel passively increases Stability, Handling and Reload Speed for dealing damage (as well as on a kill too), particularly when you're in a fireteam, which is always useful.

Abyssal Edge is only the second wave sword frame (and the only non-raid option), generating a wave frame on a heavy attack costing 4 ammo, followed up by a homing light attack costing 1.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total base ammo is 67/71/73/74 (max 77). With a burst damage roll, you'll want as much Impact as possible - look for Jagged Edge as the top choice blade perk, with Honed Edge and Tempered Edge as alternates. for the Guard Perk, Swordmaster's Guard improves Charge Rate for heavy attacks, although if you do guard to reduce incoming damage, Balanced Guard is worth a look. In the first trait perk slot, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo for three hits within 2s for better ammo economy, while in the second, the reworked Redirection trait perk lets you build up to 30 stacks by killing 15 Minor adds and use this for ×1.33 damage for 10 hits (using 3 stacks per hit.against Elite or higher enemies. Alternatively, if you're in a crowd, Surrounded passively boosts damage by ×1.4 (×1.47 when enhanced).

// Abyssal Edge (Adept) - Endgame sustained damage god
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard), Relentless Strikes, Elemental Honing
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 129 from 4 February 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/19eFPPXbMv7cC0w8kJ234H?si=d61c9144b9aa4974) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Bosses in general, and in end-game underleveled content. Abyssal Edge is only the second wave sword frame (and the only non-raid option), generating a wave frame on a heavy attack costing 4 ammo, followed up by a homing light attack costing 1. At base, the stats are identical - at the time of writing, D2Foundry isn't showing the in-game stats, but hopefully they'll be added in soon. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total base ammo is 67/71/73/74 (max 77). With a sustained damage roll, you'll want as much Impact as possible - look for Jagged Edge as the top choice blade perk, with Honed Edge and Tempered Edge as alternates. for the Guard Perk, Swordmaster's Guard improves Charge Rate for heavy attacks, although if you do guard to reduce incoming damage, Balanced Guard is worth a look. In the first trait perk slot, Relentless Strikes returns 1 ammo for three hits within 2s for better ammo economy, while in the second if you're playing a Transcendent build, Elemental Honing can work similarly to Bait and Switch to provide a ×1.35 damage boost for 20s for cycling through 5 other damage types with your abilities and other weapons. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, increasing charge rate for each ally you're within 15m of, up to 5. Recommended MW: Impact, with an Adept Impact mod. Also, don't forget to check whether there's a useful Seasonal Fragile mod for the activity you're running.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Watchful Eye, as an aggressive frame is the best of the LMGs for damage at the time of writing. At base, the stats are average - 39 Range equates to 46.99m ADS and 29.37m hipfire, 49 Stability is ×1.1653 flinch resist at 100 Resilience, 25 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.40s ADS and 0.37s stow speed, 37 Reload Speed is a 5.11s reload and Recoil Direction is 59. The mag size is 64 (max 87), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods total ammo is 429/483/538/566 (max 600). Use the barrel perk to add Handling and help control recoil to land crits easier, while you could make a case for any of the magazine perks but maybe the top choice is to look to increase mag size. For sustained damage, Overflow in the first trait column doubles the number of shots you for just picking up an ammo brick, bypassing reload altogether you can also overflow using the Runneth Over origin trait which overflows your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading and, when the stars align, they can both proc to dump around half of your total ammo into the mag. Alternatively, Enhanced Field Prep can get you to maximum ammo reserves with two reserves mods, and boosts reload speed and handling. To pair with all that ammo, Jolting Feedback synergises with arc builds to apply jolt to targets for additional damage. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.2.0.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for clearing Minor add crowds in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly wit arc builds. Psychopomp adds an S-Tier arc option to the lineup of area denial frame grenade launchers. At base, the stats are in-band - at the time of writing, D2Foundry isn't showing the in-game stats, but hopefully they'll be added in soon. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo is 24/25/25/25 (max 25). Quick Launch as the barrel perk boosts both Handling and Velocity, and the High-Velocity Rounds magazine perk adds more Velocity with Reload Speed. In the first trait perk column, Ambitious Assassin overflows the magazine for two shots from a reload after a kill, as can the Runneth Over origin trait when you're with 15m of at least one other ally and, when the stars align, they can both proc for a physics-defying three in the tube. Alternatively, for melee builds, you gain 20% ability energy per kill from Pugilist. In the second column, for arc build synergy, Rolling Thunder speeds up accumulation of Bolt Charge, adding a stack on a kill (2 when Amplified) for additional damage from lightning bolts. Runneth Over is probably the more immediately useful origin trait, overflowing your magazine by 10% of base magazine capacity per nearby ally (up to 5) when reloading.

Chroma Rush has a more PvP-oriented trait perk pool, but the origin trait the boosts handling and reload makes it viable, if you're still looking for a kinetic slot rapid fire auto-rifle. At base, the stats are decent - 25 Range equates to 22.20m ADS and 13.88m hipfire, 56 stability, 35 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.32s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, and 47 Reload Speed is a 1.86s reload (1.49s with the intrinsic rapid-fire frame boost if you reload from an empty mag). The recoil direction is mostly vertical, if loose - you can improve control with the barrel perk or, if you're comfortable maybe push out the range a little. In the magazine, on controller, a bit more Stability is nice, boost reload speed further or add some extra bullets. For the trait perk slots, Subsistence is the best for PvE in the first column, while in the second Kinetic Tremors (although the damage scaling isn't great for the AoE shockwave), or Frenzy for a ×1.15 damage boost and max Handling and Reload Speed both work. The Splicer Surge origin trait is nice for PvE - reload after dealing damage for up to three stacks, which boosts handling and reload speed by 10/20/45 and applies a reload animation multiplier of ×0.967/×0.934/×0.9.

If you're still looking for a kinetic burst damage grenade launcher Ignition Code could happily fill that gap. As a lightweight frame, you get the usual +20 mobility and ×1.0625 boost to speed. At base, the stats are decent - 72 Velocity equates to 57.25m/s, 64 Handling is 0.38s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.34s stow speed, and 64 Reload Speed is a 2.15s reload. With 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods, total ammo count is 24/25/25/25 (max 25). To maximise damage per shot, Hard Launch and Implosion Rounds in the barrel and magazine perk slots combine for ×1.225 damage and +25 Velocity, or you can forgo damage for a bit of extra handling with the barrel perk, and Spike Grenades are almost as good for damage. In the first trait perk slot, Slideshot provides a way to bypass reload, Lead From Gold keeps ammo topped off or Ambitious Assassin overflows the magazine on a kill and manual reload. For damage you have a choice of Frenzy, High Ground or Vorpal Weapon. The Splicer Surge origin trait is nice for PvE - reload after dealing damage for up to three stacks, which boosts handling and reload speed by 10/20/45 and applies a reload animation multiplier of ×0.967/×0.934/×0.9.

If you're still looking for a kinetic disorienting grenade launcher for add control, Ignition Code could happily fill that gap. As a lightweight frame, you get the usual +20 mobility and ×1.0625 boost to speed. At base, the stats are decent - 72 Velocity equates to 57.25m/s, 64 Handling is 0.38s ready, 0.38s ADS and 0.3 4s stow speed, and 64 Reload Speed is a 2.15s reload. With 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods, total ammo count is 24/25/25/25. For use for disorienting crowds of adds, look for handling and velocity with the barrel perk, as Disorienting Grenades in the magazine perk slot will set the Blast Radius to 0 regardless. In the first trait perk slot, Slideshot provides a way to bypass reload, or Lead from Gold helps with your ammo economy, and Frenzy does provide a ×1.15 damage boost, but mostly maxes out Handling, and Reload Speed too for when you're manually reloading.

Sojourner's Tale reprise has seen it a little neutered, losing trait perks that make a good burst damage weapon but it still has a niche role in clearing more difficult adds. At base, the stats are below average - 61 Range equates to 9.08m ADS and 7.57m hipfire, 40 Stability, 63 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.30s ADS and 0.36s stow speed, and 44 Reload Speed is a 0.75s reload per shell. Magazine size is 6 (max 8), and with 0/1/2/3 Ammo Reserves mods you have total ammo of 19/21/23/23 (max 24). If you are in a market for a slug shotgun for burst damage, there is a niche roll that you might consider. Boost Handing with the barrel perk, and then in the magazine perk, Assault Mag improves fire rate, or Tactical Mag (with Backup Mag) maximises magazine size. If you're able to get a kill with another weapon before you start and proc Discord, you'll not need to worry too much about ammo reserves with every kill for 7s, either directly or via Incandescent's scorch and ignition (which you can improve with solar buildcrafting), generating ammo. The Splicer Surge origin trait is nice for PvE - reload after dealing damage for up to three stacks, which boosts handling and reload speed by 10/20/45 and applies a reload animation multiplier of ×0.967/×0.934/×0.9.

It's a slug shotty that, after your first kill, grants Nightsworn Sight for 7s - further kills grant 3s of Truesight and create subminitions that weaken enemies on hit. It intrinisically disrupts Overload chmapions, so won't be affected by seasonal shotgun mods or subclass verb effects. Boost the handling by +10 with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag decreases time between shots by ×0.9 in the magazine perk slot. Short-Action Stock as the grip perk increases Handling by +15 and, of the catalyst options, Repulsor Brace Retrofit fits in with the playstyle best, as you'll be close into enemies and probably in need of the overshield from killing weakened enemies. Maybe a bit unusual to use a slug shoutgun for crowd controlling adds, but this should chew through even bulky crowds efficiently.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Red Tape is, surprisingly the first Lightweight frame stasis scout rifle - one of the stronger scout subfamilies for damage output in PvE, and offering the usual +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 boost to movement speed. At base, the stats are decent - the spread of stats among its peers is pretty compressed, though - 32 Range equates to 70.52m ADS and 35.27m hipfire, 33 Stability, 64 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30 ADS and 0.34 stow speed, and 52 Reload speed is a 1.96s reload. Look to boost Handling on M+KB, or improve control for controller with the barrel perk. In the mag, with the origin trait to bypass reload you could just go all-out for magazine size, or maybe look for additional reload speed for manual reloads in the mag perk slot. For Stasis builds, it's not the first scout rifle to offer the trait perk combination of Rimestealer, for Frost Armor stacks from breaking crystals generated by Headstone crit kills, but it's probably the best legendary that does. The Dark Ether Reaper origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation, which also overflows equipped and stowed Dark Ether weapons to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload.

Scavenger's Fate's precision frame means more predictably vertical recoil - not much of an advantage for a shotgun though. At base, the stats are decent - 60 Range equates to 5.53m, 38 Stability, 37 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.36 ADS and 0.45 stow speed, and 46 Reload speed is a 0.73s per shell reload.

// Heretic's Fervor (first-choice PvE)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Hard Launch), Impact Casing, (Field Prep, Auto-Loading Holster), Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 127 from 21 January 2025 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/27QaoJnY0M7c7Ikhz8CbUv?si=397188c406294fcf) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors sustained Boss damage in general, and end-game underleveled content. First thing to say is, if you already have a good DPS rocket launcher you can pass, even though aggressive frame rocket launchers are in the highest damage-per-shot category, as the ammo reserves are very low. At base, the other stats are decent - 68 Velocity equates to 37.84m/s, 20 Handling is 0.58s ready, 0.49 ADS and 0.48 stow speed, and 54 Reload Speed is a 3.03s per reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, total ammo count is 8/9/10/10 (max 11). If you do want to save a roll, standard practice is to boosts Velocity and/or handling with the barrel perk, and use Impact Casing as the magazine perk to boost damage a bit by ×1.022. In the first trait perk slot, Field Prep helps with reload when crouched, and maxes our total ammo at 11 with two reserves mods (only one when enhanced), or Auto-Loading Holster to reload in the background. In the second, Explosive Light boosts damage by ×1.25 for up to 6 shots (7 when enhanced). The Dark Ether Reaper origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE, although less useful for boss DPS weapons. It generates a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows equipped and stowed Dark Ether weapons to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload. So if you have a second Dark Ether weapon, that does mean that you can start a damage phase with 2 rockets loaded.

// Red Tape (first-choice PvE)

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.4 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for Minor adds in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly on grenade builds. Red Tape is, surprisingly the first Lightweight frame stasis scout rifle - one of the stronger scout subfamilies for damage output in PvE, and offering the usual +20 Mobility and ×1.0625 boost to movement speed. At base, the stats are decent - the spread of stats among its peers is pretty compressed, though - 32 Range equates to 70.52m ADS and 35.27m hipfire, 33 Stability, 64 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30 ADS and 0.34 stow speed, and 52 Reload speed is a 1.96s reload. Look to boost Handling on M+KB, or improve control for controller with the barrel perk. In the mag, with the origin trait to bypass reload you could just go all-out for magazine size, or maybe look for additional reload speed for manual reloads in the mag perk slot. If you don't already have the combination of Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie, then it's a very natural pairing. Get a grenade kill to proc the ×1.33 damage boost for 4.5s, and then recover grenade energy through add kills to rinse and repeat.

First, look to boost Handling with the barrel perk. In the mag perk slot, maybe look for additional reload speed for manual reloads for when you can't proc the origin trait to bypass reload. For add-clearing purposes, you can boost handling and reload with Loose Change, generate orbs to proc armor mods with Attrition Orbs, or regenerate health with Unrelenting in the first trait perk column.

Stay Frosty has lost some solid PvE trait perks in its reprise so there's not as much to grind for in 2024-25. At base the stats are a little sub-par - 38 Range equates to 32.05m when ADS and 18.85m hipfire, 67 Handling is a 0.33s ready, 0.33s ADS and 0.31s stow time, and 56Reload Speed is a 1.78s reload.

If you're into the glaive life, Albedo Wing provides some variety, being one of the few aggressive frames available. At base the stats are solid - 38 Range equates to 19.09m and a projectile speed of 117m/s, 35 Handling is a 0.35s ready and 0.42s stow time, 30 Shield Duration is 9.95s when fully charged and 30 Reload Speed is a 2.98s reload.

You can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can get around that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one or Light Mag improves things a little.

Accrued Redemption's trait perk pool is mostly PvP-oriented, but there's still an excellent roll to shape for use against Champions. At base the stats are solid - Draw Time is standard 0.684ms, 43 Stability equates to a Perfect Draw time of 0.43s, 55 Handling is a 0.58s ready, 0.43s ADS and 0.44s stow time, and 40 Reload Speed is a 0.73s reload. There's no reason to look far beyond the standard Elastic String as the bowstring perk and Straight Fletching as the arrow perk to reduce the draw time and recover the accuracy malus. The trait perk combination of Archer's Tempo and Kinetic Tremors will make this a great anti-champion weapon with the matching bow Artifact mod. Kinetic Tremors has the second highest combatant damage multiplier on bows and, when enhanced, only needs two hits to proc, so is just free damage against champions once stunned, as well as clearing ads in the area. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Although the Sacred Provenance Aggressive Burst subfamily isn't top tier for pulse rifle PvE damage, it wouldn't take too much to make them shine so it's worth keeping a good roll, just in case. At base the stats are good - 69 Range equates to 38.12m when ADS and 21.18m hipfire, 24 Handling is a 0.47s ready, 0.41s ADS and 0.46s stow time, and 36 Reload Speed is a 2.12s reload. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk deals with the wonky Recoil Direction of 70 and adds Handling. High-Caliber Rounds adds useful flinch or Armor-Piercing Rounds works well to the origin trait against shielded enemies. For a general purpose roll, Demolitionist in the first trait perk column is always fun and can be paired in the second with Frenzy, which maxes out the stat gaps nicely as well as boosting damage by ×1.15, or Desperate Measures for up to ×1.3 damage by using all your extra grenades.

Ancient Gospel returns as, for some reason, a void adaptive hand cannon this time with a whole load of PvP trait perks, but not much for PvE fans. At base the stats are solid - 41 Range equates to 29.54m when ADS and 19.69m hipfire, 46 Handling is a 0.34s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.38s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 2.69s reload. Recoil Direction is a perfect 100. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out your preferred stats - you might lean into Range or Handling for the barrel, and Range or Reload Speed with the magazine. There's really only one PvE trait perk roll pairing that works - Destabilizing Rounds and Explosive Payload - also useful against Overload Champions in particular, needing only two shots to disrupt when the artifact mod is around. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Omniscient Eye is a decent choice as a backup damage option against bosses once you're out of heavy ammo. At base the stats are good - 70 Handling equates to a 0.32s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.29s stow time, and 67 Reload Speed is a 2.74s reload (2.19s with the rapid-fire reload boost is you're reloading an empty magazine). Recoil Direction is a vertical, if loose, 55, magazine size is 6 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 28/30/33/34 (max 41). To land shots, a little extra control is nice - Arrowhead Brake will tighten up the recoil or Polygonal Rifling will reduce bounce as the barrel perk. Tactical Mag will maximise the magazine size and increase total ammo to near maximum levels on its own. As trait perks, in the first column, Lead From Gold improves with your ammo economy, Fourth Time's the Charm will let you hit 11 crits without reloading assuming a mag of 7 shots, or Envious Arsenal is useful when enhanced to maximise reserves (the main perk probably won't be useful as you'll likely have run out of heavy ammo so won't be able to proc the main perk). In the second column Vorpal Weapon offers a flat ×1.15 damage bonus against bosses or, for longer damage phases, Precision Instrument is ×1.2 damage for the rest of the magazine once you've hit 4 quick crits. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Prophet of Doom joins the rather large list of decent raid shotguns, so if you already have one, you might consider passing. At base the stats are good - 67 Range equates to 5.74m, 35 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.45s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 0.76s reload per shell. As it's a precision frame, you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, magazine size is 5 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). If you're still looking for a burst damage weapon, you have One-Two Punch available in the second trait perk column for ×2 melee (once that make director contact with enemies, anyway) ability damage and ×2.5 against bosses and vehicles for 1.22s. Full Choke as the barrel perk makes hitting all your pellets slightly easier and Assault Mag speeds up follow-up shots as the mag perk.

You'll need to control the frankly awful recoil direction of 59 - Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk is the best way of doing that.

In the first trait perk column, Pugilist returns 20% (22% when enhanced) melee ability energy on a kill, or there are a few perks that can help with reload in the first trait perk column - Threat Detector boosts Handling and Reload in CQC, Reconstruction passively overfills your mag over time, or Slideways partially refills after a slide. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create Ionic Traces or, when the artifact mod's around, Stunloader.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

// Prophet of Doom (PvE)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 125 from 3 December 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0unzzecMfqDsL3nxHGSQsp?si=d40055092caa4fa1) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Major PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for special weapon burst damage against Majors and Champions in general, and end-game underleveled content, particularly with arc builds. Prophet of Doom joins the rather large list of decent raid shotguns, so if you already have one, you might consider passing. At base the stats are good - 67 Range equates to 5.74m, 35 Handling equates to a 0.42s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.45s stow time, and 43 Reload Speed is a 0.76s reload per shell. As it's a precision frame, you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, magazine size is 5 (max 7) and with 0/1/2/3 Reserves mods you have total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). Although the combatant damage modifier isn't great for shotguns, Voltshot is still quite fun, if you don't have one already, and viable as you only need to reload one shell to proc it. Look for a barrel perk that boosts Handling, and then Tactical Mag helps with reload speed. There are only two perks in the first trait perk column that help further with reload - Threat Detector is easier to proc and maxes Handling and Reload Speed when you're in CQC, or Air Trigger is even faster if you're happy to bunny hop as you reload. The Photoinhibition origin trait is very strong for PvE - a ×1.343 damage boost against barriers and elemental shields and ×1.216 against combatant overshields plus disorienting your target and, if matched with the shield type adds nearby too for 7s.

Rake Angle gives a kinetic slot Glaive option at last, for anyone dreaming of triple glaive builds. At base the stats are solid - 66 Range equates to 18.60m and a projectile speed of 112.32m/s, 52 Handling is 0.31s ready speed and 0.37s stow speed, Shield Duration of 42 is 11.27s when fully charged, while the Reload Speed of 43 is a 2.75s reload. Mag size is 4 (max is 6) and with 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll start with total ammo of 24/28/31/33 (max is 33).You could look to improve Handling with Tempered Truss Rods or Shield Duration with Auxiliary Reserves as the haft perk, depending on your preference. Appended Mag as the mag perk with Backup Mag maxes out the magazine at 6 shots. The second trait slot perk that makes this special is Chill Clip to slow and disrupt Overload Champions, while two shots will freeze, and stun, Unstoppable Champions - you can also build into Stasis verbs with your fragments. To that end, Overflow is great first trait perk choice, doubling the mag size when picking up ammo even when stowed, giving nine Chill Clip shots. Alternatively, Replenishing Aegis refills the mag when you bock damage with the shield or Lead from Gold helps with the overall ammo economy. The Stunning Recovery origin trait refills the mag, and provides health and Recovery stat bumps after you deal with a Champion, so synergises well.

You could look to improve Handling with Tempered Truss Rods or Shield Duration with Auxiliary Reserves as the haft perk, depending on your preference. The Adept Backup Mag mod maxes the number of shots to 6, and none of the other mag perks really offes much so Swap Mag is probably the best of the options for faster ready and stow. The second trait perk that makes this special is Chill Clip to show and disrupt Overload Champions, while three shots with a six shot mag will freeze, and stun, Unstoppable Champions - you can also build into Stasis verbs with your fragments.

// Deadlock (first-choice PvE)
// (Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling, Barrel Shroud), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Assault Mag), (Grave Robber, Threat Detector), One-Two Punch, Short Action Stock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 124 from 19 November 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n08KP410ui1TXoEdBmsvu?si=2badf5a8fcac408d) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major and Champion enemies in general, and end-game underleveled content. I'll start by saying that there are plenty of burst damage shotguns out there so if you already have one, then don't sweat playing Comp just to pick a Deadlock up. At base the stats are good - 69 Range equates to 5.80m, 47 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.41s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 49 is a 0.79s per shell reload. Magazine size is 5 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods you get total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). Handling is the usual play for the barrel perk with Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling, although keeping the pellet spread tight with Barrel Choke can also be useful. In the magazine perk slot, Tactical or Appended Mag with Backup Mag get you to the maximum of 7 shots or Assault Mag can be helpful in faster follow-up shots. For burst damage, particularly for Liar's Handshake Hunters, Grave Robber is the best choice in the first trait perk column for automatic magazine refill on melee kills, but Threat Detector can boost Handling, Stability and Reload Speed to 100 so isn't bad either. Bot hpair well with One-Two Punch to deal ×2.0 melee damage after hitting all pellets (or 10 when enhanced). You'll have access to stocks rather than an origin trait - Short Action Stock is the best, boosting Handling by +15. Recommended MW: Handling if you don't get Threat Detector and Range if you do, with a Backup Mag mod or, when enhanced, a Synergy mod to generate Stasis shards or Stunloader when an artifact mod's around.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Probably the most chased-after Iron Banner PvE weapon in years, Tinasha's Mastery is the first Stasis rocket-assisted sidearm. At base the stats are solid - 28 Range equates to 14.56m when ADS and 12.12m hipfire (although there really isn't that much damage dropoff), 42 Handling is 0.31s ready, 0.25s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 29 is a 1.81s reload. Magazine size is 10 (maximum 16), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods you get total ammo of 40/43/46/48 (max 57). This roll is all about slowing and freezing single targets, so Velocity is far more important to boost than Blast Radius with the barrel and magazine perks. In the first perk trait slot, Air Trigger provides the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced) - useful since the nerf to reserve ammo - as well as speedy reloads if you're in the air when the animation starts. All of this is building up to Chill Clip in the second trait perk column - one shot slows, and disrupts, Overload Champions and three shots freezes, and stuns, Unstoppable champions, which you can synergise with Stasis fragments. Apply Radiant and it'll pierce Barrier champions too. It's bound to be nerfed at some point, so enjoy being totally overpowered for as long as it lasts. With the change to the Skulking Wolf origin trait, at least there is now an effect in PvE to reduce enemy accuracy when it's procced, which could be useful for survivability in more difficult content.

Yesterday's Questions is a Trials of Osiris reward so not very accessible, and High Impact rocket launchers are only mid-tier for base damage so if you have a good boss damage RL already, you can safely pass.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 10/11/12/12 (max 13). For a sustained DPS weapon there's going to be weapon swapping going on, so you'll need a handling barrel perk. Impact Casing as the magazine perk adds a little extra damage (×1.022). As a trait perk pairing, Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch proc on the same condition of of doing damage with your other weapons to reload and boost damage by ×1.35.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 10/11/12/12 (max 13). If you really insist on add clearing, maximise the blast radius and then boost velocity with the barrel and mag perks. Envious Assassin will overflow your magazine as you rack up kills with other weapons, or Air Trigger when enhanced maxes out your ammo reserves at 13 and boosts reload if you can remember to start the animation while you're in the air.  Chain Reaction's combatant damage multiplier is the best on a rocket launcher, so that should take out beefier adds and majors easily.

Yesterday's Questions is a Trials of Osiris reward so not very accessible, and High Impact rocket launchers are only mid-tier for base damage so if you have a good boss damage RL already, you can safely pass. At base the stats are good - 45 Velocity equates to 34.85m/s, 67 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.39s ADS and 0.33s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 35 is a 3.34s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 10/11/12/12 (max 13) or with Bipod 15/16/17/17 (max 18). For a burst DPS weapon you'll be more interested in Velocity or handling from the barrel perk. Impact Casing as the magazine perk adds a little extra damage (×1.022). If you're role is to buff fireteam damage, Withering Gaze in the first trait perk column will weaken targets to effectively buff everyone's damage by ×1.15 for 6s - enough time to reload and re-proc again. Frenzy maxes reload speed and handling and adds a useful, if not damage topping ×1.15 weapon damage on top. Unfortunately none of the origin traits really work for a boss damage roll, unless you're running solo content in which case use Alacrity. Recommended MW: Velocity with a Quick Access Sling mod.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Yesterday's Questions is a Trials of Osiris reward so not very accessible, and High Impact rocket launchers are really best placed for an add clearing role with the big blast radius which... seems like a waste for a RL. At base the stats are good - 45 Velocity equates to 34.85m/s, 67 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.39s ADS and 0.33s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 35 is a 3.34s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserves mods, you'll have total ammo of 10/11/12/12 (max 13). If you really insist on add clearing, maximise the blast radius and then boost velocity with the barrel and mag perks. Envious Assassin will overflow your magazine as you rack up kills with other weapons, or Air Trigger when enhanced maxes out your ammo reserves at 13 and boosts reload if you can remember to start the animation while you're in the air.  Chain Reaction's combatant damage multiplier is the best on a rocket launcher, so that should take out beefier adds and majors easily. The Wild Card origin trait works well for this roll, laying traps for any remaining adds nearby.

Bygones has been a PvP fan favourite for a long time, there's a few possible rolls that make a decent choice for a kinetic slot pulse rifle. It does drop from Gambit activities with a 12×12 trait perk pool, so if you're after it, reset your Zavala rank as many times as you're able before focusing. At base the stats are good - 48 Range equates to 33.32m range when ADS and 19.60m hipfire, 46 Handling is 0.40s ready, 0.37s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 46 is a 1.94s reload. On controllers, you'll find that straightening the recoil or boosting stability will help with control - on M+KB handling is the more obvious play for the barrel perk. The combat effect magazine perks, or something that helps reload work well too. There's a useful synergy between both Shoot to Loot and Attrition Orbs, and Kinetic Tremors shockwaves. Shoot to Loot will pick up any ammo bricks (and reload all your weapons) as well as orbs in the shockwave's area, while Attrition Orbs can be triggered by the shockwave to generate orbs faster. The Gun and Run origin trait is a bit meh, TBH but it's there anyway.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in  general, and end-game underleveled content. Wicked Sister is here for Guardians who, for any reason, can't run Trials, Raids or Dungeons. It does drop from Vanguard activities with a 12×12 trait perk pool, so if you're after it, reset your Zavala rank as many times as you're able before focusing. At base the stats are okay - 40 Handling is 0.44s ready, 0.43s ADS and 0.39s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 41 is a 3.24s reload. Mag size is 5 (max is 8) and with 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll start with total ammo of 24/26/28/28 (max is 31). Add-clearing isn't really what heavy GLs are for but, if you were looking for an option, maximise the Blast Radius with the barrel and magazine perks. In the second trait perk column, Chair Reaction detonations then extend the lethal radius on kills. First column perks worth considering are Envious Assassin to overflow your mag with kills from other weapons, Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves and reload speed, Clown Cartridge to overflow your magazine, or Auto-Loading Holster to simply reload in the background. The Nadir Focus origin Trait boosts your projectile velocity, so pairs well. Recommended MW: Bladt Radius, with a Backup Mag mod.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in  general, and end-game underleveled content. If you've missed out on decent arc sidearms from previous seasons, Anonymous Autumn is a decent option. It does drop from Crucible activities with a 12×12 trait perk pool, so if you're after it, reset your Shaxx rank as many times as you're able before focusing. At base the stats are okay - 29 Range equates to 14.59m ADS and 12.16 hipfire, 60 Handling is 0.21s ready, 0.26s ADS and 0.31s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 45 is a 1.63s reload. Range on sidearms is really compressed, so you can boost Handling and Stability (particularly for Controller) with your barrel perks, and then the Combat effect or reload magazine perks are all worth a look. As a trait perk pair, Demolitionist works well with Desperate Measures, gaining grenade energy on kills to keep the higher damage stacks (up to ×1.3) procced. You might feel more immediate benefit from the One Quiet Moment origin trait for reloads, but if you can stay alive, you'll start to feel Field Tested as you get to the higher stacks.

// Deadlock (PvE)

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for burst damage against Major and Champion enemies in general, and end-game underleveled content. I'll start by saying that there are plenty of burst damage shotguns out there so if you already have one, then don't sweat playing Comp just to pick a Deadlock up. At base the stats are good - 69 Range equates to 5.80m, 47 Handling is 0.39s ready, 0.34s ADS and 0.41s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 49 is a 0.79s per shell reload. Magazine size is 5 (maximum 7), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods you get total ammo of 20/22/24/25 (max 25). Handling is the usual play for the barrel perk with Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling, although keeping the pellet spread tight with Barrel Choke can also be useful. In the magazine perk slot, Tactical or Appended Mag with Backup Mag get you to the maximum of 7 shots or Assault Mag can be helpful in faster follow-up shots. For burst damage, Threat Remover in the first trait perk column procs at the same time as One-Two Punch to boost gunfeel stats and deal ×2.0 melee damage after hitting all pellets (or 10 when enhanced). You'll have access to stocks rather than an origin trait - Short Action Stock is the best, boosting Handling by +15.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick use against bulky Minor and Major enemies in general, and end-game underleveled content. Probably the most chased-after Iron Banner PvE weapon in years, Tinasha's Mastery is the first Stasis rocket-assisted sidearm. At base the stats are solid - 28 Range equates to 14.56m when ADS and 12.12m hipfire (although there really isn't that much damage dropoff), 42 Handling is 0.31s ready, 0.25s ADS and 0.35s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 29 is a 1.81s reload. Magazine size is 10 (maximum 16), and with 0/1/2/3 reserves mods you get total ammo of 40/43/46/48 (max 57). This roll is all about slowing and freezing single targets, so Velocity is far more important to boost than Blast Radius with the barrel and magazine perks. At the time of writing, Deconstruct might be bugged, with both the impact and explosive damage counting towards proccing, after which you get 2 shots returned (10% of the magazine, as long as it's 11 or more) for every 2 shots fired, as well as the bonus damage to constructs and vehicles. All of this is building up to Chill Clip in the second trait perk column - one shot slows, and disrupts, Overload Champions and three shots freezes, and stuns, Unstoppable champions, which you can synergise with Stasis fragments. Apply Radiant and it'll pierce Barrier champions too. The Deconstruct/Chill Clip combo keeps your magazine above half full which means you can shoot an entire magazine's worth of slowing and freezing without reloads. It's bound to be nerfed at some point, so enjoy being totally overpowered for as long as it lasts. With the change to the Skulking Wolf origin trait, at least there is now an effect in PvE to reduce enemy accuracy when it's procced, which could be useful for survivability in more difficult content.

Yesterday's Questions has a lot of caveats for PvE - it's a Trials of Osiris reward so not very accessible, the rolls are mainly PvP focussed, and it doesn't really offer anything new if you already have a Voltshot hand cannon.

It feels a lot better with help for Handling in the barrel perk. Voltshot relies on reload speed to proc and use, so Flared Magwell provides the biggest boost, or Light Mag slightly less. There's only one trait perk that helps with reload, and that's Rapid Hit. With luck and a following wind, reload speed could be as low as 1.70s so Voltshot doesn't run out to time to be procced.

Duelist benefits the player after a kill until you put the sword away, but since heavy is not very frequent in PvP, you're likely gonna commit to using all your ammo up. So Duelist gives the best benefit in slot imo. Vorpal is a nice safety net in case your heavy spawn gets assaulted by a super (I've seen it happen, it's terrifying), you might be able to fight back a little easier."

The amount of orbs you can generate is almost as strong as OG Tether back in Year 1 Eater of Worlds. Lorathexplorer almost crashed my game multiple times with how many orbs she made. For general use Attrition Orbs is great but I feel the perk interaction is slightly unintended.

// Red Tape
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Red Tape doesn't do anything exceptional but it does play into Stasis shenanigans if you use the crystals to gain a new sightline. You don't have to be near the Stasis crystal or enemy which means you can get Frost Armor from anywhere across the map. Keep Away and Lone Wolf also lean into this but don't give as many benefits. Explosive Payload would be great for fighting duals as the extra flinch is incredibly frustrating to fight against." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

High Ground is easy to proc and if you've got enough room you can keep sliding back and forth with your enhanced damage. Ambitious Assassin, Lead From Gold and Unrelenting are all great perks on their own and I wouldn't be upset with them. Paired with Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon for damage and you've got yourself a solid workhorse weapon. Outside of the Area Denial frame this can still fit most any loadout."

There was a time when slug shotties like Legato-11 were the meta for CQC Boss damage. They're still decent, mind, and it wouldn't take much of a buff for their glory days to return. At base the stats are very good - 65 Range equates to 9.22m while ADS and 7.69m hipfire, 68 Handling is 0.32s ready speed, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 48 is a 0.72s reload per shell. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 19/20/22/23 shots (maximum is 23) and magazine size of 6 (maximum is 8). Slug SGs have the same vertical recoil boost as Precisions, so you can largely ignore recoil direction, and use the barrel perk to boost Handling. You have options for the magazine perk - Assault Mag increases your fire rate, and thus DPS. You can hit the maximum mag size of 8 with either Tactical Mag (which also boosts Stability and Reload Speed) or Appended Mag and a Backup Mag mod. Or you can boost Range and Reload Speed with Light Mag. For sustained boss damage, you can go one of two ways - Triple Tap will let you shoot 12 times before reloading with the max mag size of 8, or Auto-Loading Holster lets you swap to a kinetic slot slug SG continue DPS while it reloads in the background. For a damage perk, Vorpal Weapon or Frenzy (which also maxes out Handling and Reload Speed when procced) boost damage by ×1.15, or Focused Fury can provide ×1.2 damage after you've hit crits with your first four shots.

With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 21/23/24/25 shots (max is 27) and magazine size of 3 (maximum 5). Both Handling and Reload Speed could do with a little help with barrel and magazine perks, although there's also something to be said for a larger capacity mag too. A unique special weapon trait perk combination, for niche use against vehicles and constructs to possibly tuck away for an "in case of emergency, break glass" moment in end-game activities is Deconstruct (×1.4 damage to vehicles and constructs), Vorpal Weapon (×1.15 damage to vehicles and constructs) together with the Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait (×1.15 damage to vehicles and ×1.3 damage to constructs). Altogether, that makes a ×1.8515 damage boost to vehicles and ×2.093 damage to constructs.

Or you can boost Range and Reload Speed with Light Mag. For sustained boss damage, you can go one of two ways - Triple Tap will let you shoot 12 times before reloading with the max mag size of 8, or Auto-Loading Holster lets you swap to a kinetic slot slug SG and continue DPS while it reloads in the background. For a damage perk, Vorpal Weapon or Frenzy (which also maxes out Handling and Reload Speed when procced) boost damage by ×1.15, or Focused Fury can provide ×1.2 damage after you've hit crits with your first four shots. The Suros Synergy origin trait only procs after a manual reload, but it's always nice to have extra handling.

// Veleda-F (first-choice PvE)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Appended Mag, Tactical Mag, Extended Mag, Alloy Mag), Air Trigger, Withering Gaze
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 123 from 19 November 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n08KP410ui1TXoEdBmsvu?si=79e5ef3228b24096) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility pick to weaken Bosses and Majors in general, and end-game underleveled content. Veleda-F is, hopefully, a harbinger future void snipers that we can consider in a fireteam's loadout for major and boss damage, even though aggressive frames aren't the optimal choice for damage. At base the stats are average - 47 Zoom, 80 Range, 30 Handling is 0.43s ready speed, 0.44s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 27 is a 3.26s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 21/23/24/25 shots (max is 27) and magazine size of 3 (maximum 5). Both Handling and Reload Speed could do with a little help with barrel and magazine perks, although there's also something to be said for a larger capacity mag too. Air Trigger in the first trait perk column provides the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced) for more total ammo and, if you can co-ordinate starting reloading during a jump, adds 30 to Reload Speed and a ×0.8 reload animation duration. Withering Gaze in the second column applies the same weaken debuff as Divinity - effectively a ×1.15 boost to damage for 6s for the whole fireteam, so could be used in combination with a Boss damage heavy weapon. Interestingly, you can also extend the timer of sources of 30% weaken, such as Felwinter's Helm and Tractor Cannon (but not Hunter Tethers unfortunately) by using Withering Gaze to reapply the debuff. Hopefully in future we'll see the trait in the first column of a sniper rifle. If you're interested, Veleda was a priestess and prophet of the Bructeri Germanic tribe during the Batavian rebellion against Rome in 69–70 CE. The Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait increases damage against vehicles (×1.15), constructs (×1.3) and Stasis crystals (×1.45), which can be situationally useful.

// Fair Judgment (first-choice PvE)
// Corkscrew Rifling, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Rimestealer, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 123 from 19 November 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3n08KP410ui1TXoEdBmsvu?si=79e5ef3228b24096) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add clearing minor enemies in general non-underleveled content, particularly for Stasis builds. Fair Judgment is a decent stasis auto rifle, if you're looking for one, offering better integration with the Stasis verb toolkit than previous versions. At base the stats are solid - 59 Range equates to 29.00m while ADS and 08.13m hipfire, 45 Handling is 0.39s ready speed, 0.31s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 43 is a 1.92s reload. With this being a precision frame, you can pretty much ignore the recoil direction stat. Corkscrew Rifling adds a little bit of everything as the barrel perk, and Armor-Piercing Rounds is decent option to overpenetrate targets and a ×1.05 damage boost to shields and barriers - useful for when the anti-barrier seasonal artifact mod's around. For Stasis synergy, the combination of Rimestealer and Headstone gives you Stasis crystals on crit kills, and Frost Armor stacks when you shatter them for AoE damage, which you can use fragments to enhance further. The origin trait options of Vanguard Vindication, for a small health bump on a kill, or One Quiet Moment for +20 Handling, +40 Reload Speed with a ×0.95 reload animation duration when out of combat are both useful. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to create more Stasis shards or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Arcane Embrace is the first of a new subfamily of Heavy Burst shotguns, which look like they might be the new top pick for special weapon boss DPS, doing 9.88% more damage that slug shotguns if both shits hit.

At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 26/29/33/34, but you can chew through ammo fast, firing two shots with each trigger pull. The usual play for shotguns of boosting handling with the barrel perk still applies and, as there's no Assault Mag, look to a magazine perk that helps with Reload Speed.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 121 from 5 November 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/64p7wnHATJnZB8jnnJUnhP?si=f5552155425a4d6a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors, Champions and Bosses in general and end-game, underleveled, content. Arcane Embrace is the first of a new subfamily of Heavy Burst shotguns, which look like they might be the new top pick for special weapon boss DPS, doing 9.88% more damage that slug shotguns if both shits hit. The stats look similar to Pin Point Slug shotties too, and by that standard are pretty decent. At base, with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 26/29/33/34, but you can chew through ammo fast, firing two shots with each trigger pull. The usual play for shotguns of boosting handling with the barrel perk still applies and, as there's no Assault Mag, look to a magazine perk that helps with Reload Speed. When in CQC, the trait perk combination of Threat Detector, boosting gunfeel when you're near 2+ enemies, and Surrounded for a chunky ×1.4 boost to damage (×1.47 when enhanced) when you're near 3 or more enemies, is hard to beat to burst down Majors, Champions and the occasional Boss. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Recommended MW: Handling, Reload Speed depending on your preference, with a Backup Mag mod or, when masterworked, Synergy to generate Ionic Traces or Stunloader when there's a matching artifact mod.|tags:PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Void rapid-fire grenade launcher Acosmic returns with a couple of new tricks for a boss damage. The stats look decent out of the box. At base, 25 Handling translates to 0.48s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.43 stow speed, and with 0/1/2/3 Reserve mods, you hold total ammo of 33/35/37/38 shots. For boss damage, Hard Launch as the barrel perk squeezes a tiny bit more damage out of Spike Grenades, but otherwise look for one that boosts velocity. Air Trigger may sound like a weird recommendation for the first trait perk, but it's more for the additional reserves - equivalent to 1.5 reserve mods (2 mods when enhanced) and, as long as you start your reload animation while in the air, the whole reload will be sped up. You'll need a fast reload to use with Bait and Switch for the ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. The Search Party origin trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced, but don't overlook Nadir Focus for extra velocity. If you're interested, Acosmic is named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense (according to Merriam-Webster).

For boss damage, Hard Launch as the barrel perk squeezes a tiny bit more damage out of Spike Grenades, but otherwise look for one that boosts velocity. For boss damage, in the first trait perk column, Withering Gaze give access to Void weakening if you're not on a void subclass or for you to work with subclass fragments if you are, for an effective ×1.15 damage boost, together with Bait and Switch in the second for ×1.3 damage (which is a ×1.495 total damage boost when both are procced), which helps offset the lack of a reload perk. Maybe a roll to tuck away for a season/episode when we don't have access to weakening via an artifact mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for arc builds. Mechabre (it's so obviously a Transformers pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. One thing you could do is use it to apply jolt to beefier targets at a distance. At base, Handling of 26 equates to 0.44s ready speed, 0.45s ADS speed and 0.39s stow speed, and Reload Speed of 30 is a 3.20s reload. With 0/1/2/3 reserve mods, you'll have total ammo of 22/24/26/26 of a max total ammo of 27. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk. Building towards the end, Flared Magwell gives the biggest boost to reload speed out of the magazine perks, with Tactical Mag a decent alternative. Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85. Alternatively, Air Trigger can boost Reload Speed by the same +30 when you start the reload animation off the ground, and boosts total ammo by the equivalent of 1.5 reserves mods (2 when enhanced). Get one kill against an add, reload and then Voltshot in the second column as the signature perk can apply Jolt to your next target from a safe distance for burst and AoE damage, and to synergise with arc fragments. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

VS Gravitic Arrest is the first ever legendary void adaptive FR in D2 so, if you've been yearning for one, your wait is over! The stats are on the low side though.

At base, 42 Range equates to 25.60m while ADS, 60 Handling is 0.35s ready, 0.28s ADS speed and 0.32s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 50 is a 1.81s reload.

Jolting Feedback is a great end-game trait perk, applying Jolt on the 16th bullet (12 when Amplified) - and one fewer (15 and 11) when Enhanced - and not requiring a kill to proc.

With 0/1/2/3 reserves, you have 24/25/25/25 total ammo. For the barrel and mag perks, look to boost velocity without damaging Blast Radius. You'll likely be looking to Attrition Orbs in the second trait perk column and its ability to print multiple orbs with each shot -  it's not clear yet whether this is bugged and in need of a nerf (but it kinda feels like it might). To pair with that in the first trait column, Demolitionist should get grenade ability back quickly to use as a reload perk, Under-Over should quickly cook non-matching elemental shields and the hidden damage resistance shields of Subjugators, or Unrelenting provides health regeneration.

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades.

On controller, you might benefit from some stability from the barrel perk or, if you prefer, focus on handling. You could look to boost Reload Speed with the magazine perk but, if you're willing to play into the Dark Ether origin trait, you'll get value from boosting the magazine size. For Stasis synergy, the new-to-season-25 trait perk Rimestealer is a natural pairing to Headstone - break the stasis crystal generated from a crit kill, or a frozen enemy, to generate a stack of Frost Armor (two stacks when enhanced).

Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 - that aside, the stats are decent.

At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a utility roll that uses Disorienting Grenades as the magazine perk, Blast Radius is irrelevant as it'll always end up at 0, so use the barrel perk to boost Velocity and Handling with Quick Launch. For Stasis synergy, the combination of new-to-season-25 Rimestealer and Chill Clip should disorient and slow enemies up to and including Champions and Minibosses - Whisper of Durance on a Stasis subclass will extend the slow effect. With other sources of slow and freeze, shattering frozen targets (and Stasis crystals) grants a stack of Frost Armor - two stacks when enhanced.

At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a general purpose crowd control roll, maximise the Blast Radius with Volatile Launch and then, as there's no other magazine perk options that really work, Spike Grenades provides a ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts. As the trait perks, in the first column Rimestealer can work if you have access to other Stasis verbs as part of your build, to generate Frost Armor on frozen enemy kills or stasis crystal shattering, or bypass reloads with Slideways.

Insurmountable is a void precision sidearm, which means you can basically ignore the Recoil Direction stat. At base, 50 Range equates to 15.60m when ADS, 38 Handling is 0.32s ready, 0.26s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 21 is a 1.90s reload. Range on sidearms is pretty compressed, so a barrel perk offering Handling is probably your first choice, maybe with a touch of Stability if you're on controller. In the magazine, look for perks that provide extra shots or faster reloads. For void synergy, the trait perk combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds, keep you safe with an Void Overshield while you're clearing crowds of volatile enemies - maybe to pair with Echoes of Persistence and Starvation. The Dark Ether origin trait is one of the best in the sandbox for PvE - generate a Dark Ether charge for 5s from kills, and then shoot with any weapon (or run into) the charge to proc a Dragonfly-type detonation which also overflows your weapon to ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced, completely bypassing reload. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod, or possibly a Synergy (to proc Echo of Starvation), Tactical or Ammo Finder Enhancement mod when enhanced.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller

Insurmountable is an arc adaptive Pulse Rifle with overall in-band stats. At base, 42 Range equates to 32.55m when ADS, 40 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.38s ADS speed and 0.41s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 42 is a 2.01s reload. You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size and reload speed. But what makes this weapon special is the combination of Eddy Current to boost reload and handling when procced, and the new-to-season-25 Jolting Feedback trait which will passively apply Jolt to targets after 15 hits on enemies (or 11 when amplified) - great for additional chunk damage on a target and clearing nearby adds with the AoE damage.

Sovereignty is a void adaptive Sniper Rifle with overall in-band stats so, unfortunately it's not as good as a rapid-fire as a backup boss damage weapon. At base, it has 45 Zoom, 40 Handling which equates to 0.39s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 39 is a 3.04s reload. Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 21/23/25/26. You might find a little help with the recoil direction useful or, if you can handle it, look for some extra handling or stability. In the magazine perk slot, look to increase magazine size - Appended or Extended Mag with a Backup Mag mod takes total ammo to 25/27/29/30. Combined with the origin trait, you can potentially get 10 in an overflowed mag (13 when the weapon's enhanced). In the second trait perk column is the new-to-season-25 Withering Gaze, which can apply void Weaken global debuff from a safe distance after ADSing for 1.5s (to possibly pair with Echoes of Harvest and Starvation?), for a ×1.15 damage boost while active. There's nothing much that synergises in the first column, so Explosive Payload is tried and trusted for a bit of extra damage, and some flinch.

Bitter/Sweet is an arc adaptive grenade launcher with decent stats.

Total ammo at base with 0, 1, 2 and 3 reserve mods is 25/27/28/29. For an excellent boss damage roll, boost the Velocity and Handling with the barrel perk, and add Spike Grenades for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts in the magazine. If you lean into the origin trait, this could result in an overflowed magazine of 10 (13 when the weapon is enhanced!). The new-for-season-25 Envious Arsenal in the first trait perk column procs on the same condition as Bait and Switch, so a full weapon damage rotation will reload the base magazine from reserves and provide a further ×1.3 damage boost for 10s. If you can proc the excellent Dark Ether origin trait before DPS starts, you can overflow the magazine by ×1.4 (rounded up) base capacity or ×1.8 when enhanced.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.1.0.2 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE utility pick for crowd control in both general and end-game, underleveled content, particularly with Stasis builds. Liturgy is the fourth double fire GL, and the first Stasis energy type with a weirdly lower Blast Radius of 40 - that aside, the stats are decent. At base, 89 Velocity equates to 63.78m/s, 47 Handling is 0.42s ready, 0.41s ADS speed and 0.38s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 32 is a 2.62s reload. At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. For a utility roll that uses Disorienting Grenades as the magazine perk, Blast Radius is irrelevant as it'll always end up at 0, so use the barrel perk to boost Velocity, and Handling if possible. For Stasis synergy, the combination of new-to-season-25 Rimestealer and Chill Clip should disorient and slow enemies up to and including Champions and Minibosses - Whisper of Durance on a Stasis subclass will extend the slow effect. With other sources of slow and freeze, shattering frozen targets (and Stasis crystals) grants a stack of Frost Armor - two stacks when enhanced.

At base, with 0, 1, 2 or 3 chest reserves mods, you'll get total ammo of 22/23/24/25 which can be boosted by trait perks. Counter-intuitively, for single-target damage, the lower the blast radius, the more damage you cause, so reduce the low BR even further with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and Implosion Rounds in the magazine - although Spike Grenades, for its ×1.027 damage boost on direct impacts, is also very good. If you're using this in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation, Envious Arsenal in the first trait column will reload (and also boosts ammo reserves by the equivalent of 1 reserves mod, or 2 when enhanced), or if not, and you're moving between damage plates, Slideways does the same. There's no useful damage perk in the second column, but if you have Chill Clip, then you can use Prismatic's Facet of Courage for a ×1.1 damage multiplier with a light-based heavy weapon or super. You won't get much use from the excellent Dark Ether origin trait from this roll, unfortunately, as it's more about setting up for boss damage than kills.

If you're going all in to an army of Threadlings build, the Weaver's Call aspect is an obvious choice, and you'll probably want Facet of Honor, Awakening and maybe Solitude to create more Tangles and benefit from destroying them, or your own choice of fragments to boost the utility of your grenade, melee and rift, and gameplay preferences.

You'll want an AoE grenade for maximum effect on Osmiomancy, and then it's pretty much dealer's choice on weapons, super, aspects and fragments to support your gameplay preferences - maybe an AoE grenade like Vortex with the Feed the Void aspect to proc Devour, and Facets of Bravery for void weapon volatile rounds and Dominance to weaken enemies with grenades too?

This cries out for use with the Gambler's Dodge class ability to keep you punching, dodging and regenerating health, the Combination Blow melee, Grapple grenade, and Winter's Shroud and Stylish Executioner aspects for a pretty much one-Guardian army (while there are Minor adds to kill, anyway), although be warned that sometimes the damage can be confusingly inconsistent.

One the one hand, Inmost Light will boost abilities and regeneration time just by using them, while Verity can boost grenade damage by up to ×2 on matching weapon damage.

Chronophage is only the second legendary void trace rifle since season 17 and, unfortunately its stats are on the low side. At base, 67 Range equates to 34.51m while ADS, 51 handling is 0.38s ready, 0.29s ADS speed and 0.35s stow speed, while the reload speed of 44 is a 2.06s reload. Total ammo is the lowest of its peers at only 430 out of the box (478/527/551 with 1/2/3 reserve mods), so to be useful this does need addressing. On controller, Stability is useful to keep the beam on a crit area, or if you're using M+KB you can add Handling with the barrel park. For the battery perk, Enhanced Battery boosts the total ammo to 456 (508/559/585) and Ionized Battery gets you to 461 (513/565/591). For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait perk is always useful to pick up ammo blocks and power orbs, but also reloads all your weapons, bypassing reload penalties. In the second, One for All provides an easy to proc a ×1.35 damage boost, or Desperate Measures is easy to proc while Transcendent with grenade and melee kills, for up to a ×1.3 boost. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the weapon's damage multiplier, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

// Breachlight (first-choice PvE)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag), Slice, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 115 from 6 September 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6axWXT6NCn4jZVuRkCTfiu?si=72aafbad8138409a) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): First-choice PvE utility pick for use against major and boss enemies in end-game content, particularly with Strand builds. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by -40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune). This sets up Strand Tangle creation to proc the ×1.2 damage for 7s from Collective Action in the second column. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage. If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves.

Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. In the first trait perk column, Rapid Hit helps with both recoil control and reload on crit hits, while to boost damage, Kinetic Tremors is good for a bit of flinch and AoE damage after 6 hits, or Explosive Payload does much the same job is a smaller area. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Perfect Paradox is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid burst damage shotgun to help with beefier minors, majors and champions. It's a rapid-fire frame, so you get better reserves and a reload boost when empty (however, with available traits, you probably won't be manually reloading a lot).

You can boost handling with Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling as the barrel perk or Full Choke controls pellet spread a bit. Not having to worry about manual reloading, you can add a little range with the magazine perk instead. Then, in the first trait perk column, for a burst damage weapon Field Prep when enhanced maximises your total ammo without having to use any reserves, or Slideshot provides one way to reload, by sliding (and also boosts range by +20), combined with One-Two Punch, to double non-ranged melee damage.

High Velocity Rounds is the best magazine perk, boosting Velocity and Reload Speed. In the first trait perk slot, Field Prep takes the total ammo to its maximum of 25, without the need for reserves mods, and speeds up reloads to 1.44s when procced, but Auto-Loading Holster means you're always ready to shoot or Envious Assassin overflows the magazine to get up to 3 in the mag after 11 kills with other weapons.

Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, with there being only one way to the maximum battery size of 7 shots, which is Ionized Battery and a Backup Mag mod (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s). In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE utility pick for use against major and boss enemies in end-game content, particularly with Strand builds. Breachlight is back, this time as a Strand version of the heavy burst sidearm. Its stats are decent at base - 48 Range equates to 15.50m while ADS, 35 Handling is 0.33s ready, 0.27s ADS speed and 0.36s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 1.87s reload. The range is pretty compressed on sidearms, so you'll probably feel the most benefit with barrel perks that boost handling, and then look to boost your magazine size, preferably while not harming reload too much with the mag perk. As a utility pick, pairing Slice in the first trait column, particularly on a Hunter with the quick dodge cooldown, to apply the Sever verb to up to five targets and reduce their damage output by 40% (that's a multiplier of ×0.6 - very handy against heavy-hitting enemies, working even when they're immune). In the second column Vorpal Weapon boosts damage by ×1.2 against majors and bosses with no proccing, which makes this an excellent choice for use in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage. If you're interested, a Speleologist is someone involved in the scientific study or exploration of caves.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for add clearing Minor in end-game content. Okay, Scout Rifles aren't meta and, if you do opt for one, Rapid Fire frames are most people's top choice subfamily, but don't pass too fast on Patron of Lost Causes. It's a lightweight frame, so you gain +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed to start. Its stats are in-band at base - 33 Range equates to 70.85m while ADS, 63 Handling is 0.36s ready, 0.30s ADS speed and 0.34s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 53 is a 1.94s reload. With it being fast-firing, recoil control needs looking at, either with Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling as the barrel perk. As the magazine perk, Tactical Mag offers a bit of everything, but Flared Magwell and Appended Mag are worth a look too. If you're able to hit consistent crits, the trait perk combination of Triple Tap and either Precision Instrument or Focused Fury will help keep the higher damage stacks up for longer before reloading. The Cast No Shadows origin trait is great for topping off roughly 20% of your magazine and boosting handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

// Line in the Sand (first-choice PvE)
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.4 (PvE PvE-Boss PvE-BossSpec PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller): PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game content. Line in the Sand is back from the great sunsetting and provides an avenue for new players to obtain a solid arc LFR if you don't already have one. Its stats are decent at base - 26 Handling equates to 0.46s ready, 0.37s ADS speed and 0.37s stow speed, while the Reload Speed of 23 is a 2.44s reload and you'll start with 23 total ammo (24/26/27 with 1/2/3 reserve mods). Handling can be improved with the right barrel perk, to improve snappiness and, with there being only one way to the maximum battery size of 7 shots, which is Ionized Battery and a Backup Mag mod (although this does increase reload time to 2.81s). In the trait perk slots, for boss damage, Rapid Hit can offset the reload speed malus - 5 crits bring the reload to 1.72s and boost stability by 25 to make landing crits easier or, if you can live with the slow reload, Clown Cartridge can overflow your mag so it's at 8-11 shots. For an easy ×1.2 damage boost with easy proccing conditions (just stand near your fireteam), Firing Line is still a decent choice. Unless you're using a ranged melee, you probably won't see much benefit from the Cast No Shadows origin trait which reloads, and boosts handling for a short time on dealing melee damage.

Even if you hit 100 recoil, it's still tough to control on controller, so look to boost stability with your barrel and mag perks - a little extra reload speed never hurts too.

Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - so Fluted Barrel is the barrel perk to choose. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots (so maybe a reload mod on your boots will help?). That's important for Chill Clip in the first trait slot, as it means you'll have three Chill Clip shots. For anti-Champion use, one shot will slow and disrupt an Overload champion and two will freeze and stun an Unstoppable (with a third shot ready, just in case). You can also pierce barriers by simply becoming radiant, and all at a nice, safe range. The second column trait is less important as this is more of a utility roll, but you'll likely have built up two stacks of Chaos Reshaped in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost.

Shapeable. Nullify offers a stacked trait perk set, in the best pulse rifle subfamily. Base stats are very good and equate to 37.40m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.05s reload speed. The recoil isn't too bad, if you pace your shots but the handling and reload speed could do with some help from the barrel and mag perks. In the first trait column, to pair with Incandescent in the second (even better when synergising with solar fragments), Firefly spreads the scorch over a wider area to clear add-dense areas. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

Shapeable. Nullify offers a stacked trait perk set, in the best pulse rifle subfamily. Base stats are very good and equate to 37.40m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.05s reload speed. The recoil isn't too bad, if you pace your shots but the handling and reload speed could do with some help from the barrel and mag perks. Boss-tier Subjugators have a 20% damage reduction to all non-matching damage, going up to 30% DR to all damage after they "screech". This counts as a "shield" in-game and reacts to shield-based trait perks like Under-Over, which provides a +50% damage bonus. You'll get the same bonus damage to help pierce Barrier Champions. Add in the +35% damage bonus and sporadic healing from two stacks of Chaos Reshaped, or the simpler automatic +15% of Vorpal Weapon for handy additional damage.

Shapeable. Forthcoming Deviance is only the second legendary rapid-fire glaive, so there's not much to compare it against. Base stats do look very good and equate to 17.84m range before damage dropoff at a shot speed of 105.04m/s, 0.26s ready and 0.30s stow speed, shield duration of 9.73s, and 2.29s reload speed. The weakness in the frame type is shield duration, so if you want to mitigate this, Auxiliary Reserves is the best of the haft perks. Appended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod gets you to the maximum of 7 shots without any penalties. In the first trait column, this is the first glaive to offer Reconstruction, and this pairs well with Close to Melee in the second - get a refreshable 30% boost to melee damage for 10s after a projectile kill, and then let your magazine overflow while you slash your way through adds. Alternatively, Grave Robber and Replenishing Aegis both also offer ways to reload in the background. One thing worth remembering with glaives, if you're pairing them with a Desperate Measures primary or heavy weapon is that three glaive melee kills will proc all three stacks in your stowed weapon, ready for use, without using any ammo or ability energy.

Shapeable. Summon Bonum is a Latin expression meaning "the supreme good from which all others are derived", and also now an interesting sword too. Stats are pretty much uniform with swords, and this is our first legendary wave frame - much like a a grenade launcher with the heavy attack, with a follow-up targeted attack - hopefully to finish off a weakened enemy. For a boss damage roll, Jagged Edge - with an Backup Mag mod and three reserves mods you'll have 68 ammo, only 2 shy of the maximum of 70 - and Swordmaster's Guard are the usual safe pairing for the blade and guard perks. In trait column one you've got a choice - Relentless Strikes returns one ammo for every third hit but Attrition Orbs might not be the worst call as, with the heavy wave attack you'll get multiple hits counting towards the 10 you need to generate an orb, which you can use to keep weapon surges active, and heal. In the second column Bait and Switch offers a 35% damage bonus when procced, or you could use Whirlwind Blade for up to 30%, Surrounded (depending on the encounter and whether you have adds around or not) for +35% (+41.75% when enhanced). Chaos Reshaped might work, but it'll depend how long you're out of combat (you only have 5s of not dealing or taking damage) before a boss damage phase begins. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers a small boosts to charge rate, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod.

Stats are pretty much uniform with swords, and this is our first legendary wave frame - much like a a grenade launcher with the heavy attack, with a follow-up targeted attack - hopefully to finish off a weakened enemy. For a boss damage roll, Jagged Edge and Swordmaster's Guard are the usual safe pairing for the blade and guard perks. In trait column one you've got a choice - Relentless Strikes returns one ammo for every third hit but Attrition Orbs might not be the worst call as, with the heavy wave attack you'll get multiple hits counting towards the 10 you need to generate an orb, which you can use to keep weapon surges active, and heal. In the second column Bait and Switch offers a 35% damage bonus when procced, or you could use Whirlwind Blade for up to 30%, Surrounded (depending on the encounter and whether you have adds around or not) for +35% (+41.75% when enhanced). Chaos Reshaped might work, but it'll depend how long you're out of combat (you only have 5s of not dealing or taking damage) before a boss damage phase begins. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers a small boosts to charge rate, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Impact, with an Adept Impact mod.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.0.8 (PvE / PvE-Utility / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for anti-Champion use. Shapeable. Base stats are excellent by comparison to its peers, and equate to 0.45s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.39s stow speed, and 3.30s reload speed. Handling is always useful on aggressive snipers - stability is less of a concern if you pace your shots - so Fluted Barrel is the barrel perk to choose, and Arrowhead Brake is decent. Even though it tanks your reload to 3.72s, Extended Mag plus a Backup Mag mod takes you to 5 shots (so maybe a reload mod on your boots will help?). That's important for Chill Clip in the first trait slot, as it means you'll have three Chill Clip shots. For anti-Champion use, one shot will slow and disrupt an Overload champion and two will freeze and stun an Unstoppable (with a third stot ready, just in case). You can also pierce barriers by simply becoming radiant, and all at a nice, safe range. The second column trait is less important as this is more of a utility roll, but Chaos Reshaped is likely to have built up two stacks in your back pocket for a chunky +35% damage boost, or Explosive Payload provides a small damage boost without any proccing needed. The Collective Purpose origin trait only works in a fireteam, but offers small boosts to range and handling, which is always useful. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Relativism (first-choice PvE)

You can use any grenade, but Grapple grenade with the melee follow-up also counts to proc Caliban's. For the melee ability, the Threaded Spike melee can chain multiple ignitions, or a more traditional Combination Blow is a natual pairing to the Liar intrinsic side. Then Gambler's Dodge near enemies to get your melee back and repeat until the room's clear. The Caliban ignitions will stun Overload champions, but as you'll be up close, you might need to think about a bit of invisibility, damage resistance and/or healing somewhere else in your subclass setup and armour mods. So maybe try Stylish Executioner and Winter's Shroud Aspects (dodge applies slow nearby, and then killing slowed enemies makes you invisible), and then Facets of Sacrifice, Courage, Dawn, Protection, and Ruin - Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions. If you're looking for healing then, maybe swap out Sacrifice for Blessing, which starts health regeneration on melee kills. And, seeing as you're asking, Relativism is a philisophical theory that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-MajorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-EndGame PvE-God M+KB Controller

Spirit of Galanor returns super energy on hits and final blows, while Spirit of the Star Eater boosts super damage by up to 70% at six stacks, just by picking up orbs. It's that easy!

Throwing the grenade in either case with Cyrtarachne grants Woven Mail for -45% damage reduction. With Renewal, you're restricted to Duskfield Grenades, but they are good with the slowing and freezing effective on Overload and Unstoppable Champions, plus Renewal's effect of reducing damage output from enemies by -50% and providing allies with Frost Armour. With Spirit of Inmost Light, you can use any grenade (although Duskfield is still very good) and rely on the short cooldown of your Gambler's Dodge with Combination Blow to keep the fast ability regeneration going. The Facet of Balance, in particular, is good here to boost grenade energy on rapid darkness kills, but Aspects and Fragments will largely depend on your super, and neutral game buildcrafting goals, so there's not really any specific recommendations.

Synthoceps boosts melee damage by 200% while in CQC with 3 or more enemies, while Inmost Light helps recover your melee energy as fast as possible by using your other abilities. Choose Frenzied Blade to start with three charges to sue with Consecration, Thruster or Rally Barricade for the shortest cooldown, and a Grapple grenade for another source of darkness debuff. You can pair that with a Drengr's Lash or Diamond Lance Aspect for even more sources of darkness debuffs. For fragments, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Ruin play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Consecration), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), while you're radiant you get bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills with Sacrifice, Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more ignition damage against slowed/severed enemies), and Ruin increases the size of ignitions.

Star Eater boosts super damage by +70% at six stacks, while Eternal Warrier grants four stacks of a matching weapon surge, boosting damage by +25% for 30s - this will stack with weapon boosts like Bait and Switch, Explosive Light and Firing Line.

Neither is particulary strong in an endgame environment on their own, so probably not for a GM Nightfall. You'll obviously need to use the Drengr's Lash Aspect, but the other is dealer's choice and Fragments of Hope, Courage, Protection and Purpose play well - picking up orbs applies a beneficial subclass verb to yourself with Purpose, and while that verb is active Hope boosts the barricade ability recharge rate on kills; Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent) and Courage boosts the scorch damage on a suspended enemy.And, seeing as you're asking, Stoicism is a philisophical theory holding that wise people should be free from passion, unmoved by joy or grief.|tags:PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-Champion PvE-God M+KB Controller

Maybe one to use with a full set of Pale Heart weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin trait, for faster super recharge - with two excellent Strand weapons in the set, in The Call and Pro Memoria, that would pair well with the Needlestorm super, so you can use your super for burst damage on a boss and get straight into weapons and ability spam. Aspects and Fragments will largely depend on your super, and neutral game buildcrafting goals, so there's not really any specific recommendations.

// Solipsism (PvE)
// Spirit of Osmiomancy, Spirit of Verity
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-Utility PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for grenade-focussed builds, you're using Osmiomancy more for the improved grenade energy regeneration on hits side of the perk, and not for the improved Coldsnap seekers, so you can use any grenade except Healing - Storm and Vortex are probably strongest. The Verity perk provides a +20% bonus to grenade damage per stack, up to 100% at 5 stacks with weapon damage matching your super. With the rest of a prismatic build, Song of Flame as the super is just too good not to use at the time of writing, with Arcane Needle for three melee charges. The Feed the Void Aspect is an obvious choice to proc Devour when you use your grenade, then choose between Hellion or Weaver's Call for the other. Depending on the grenade ability you choose, Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection, and Dominance can work - Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more grenade damage against unravelled enemies), Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with your grenades and solar weapon kills), powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), and Dominance grants weaken to void grenades or jolting to arc grenades.

// Spirit of the Necrotic, Spirit of the Claw;
//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): Primarily for melee-focussed builds, but there's also some synergy with the Weapons of Sorrow and glaive lovers. It's pretty simple - Claw provides an additional melee charge, Necrotic melees poison enemies and killing poisoned enemies spreads the poison. The additional damage isn't huge, but it prevents shield regeneration and lets you keep track of an enemy's position. Necrotic also works with glaive melee attacks (so you might want to bring one with the "Close to Melee" trait perk) and Weapons of Sorrow, and Claw also works with the Song of Flame exotic to give you two finger snaps. Alongside this in a prismatic build, Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges at base, and four with Claw and you can choose pretty much any grenade. For Aspects, Feed the Void will proc Devour on an ability kill, paired with Lightning Surge to use melee charges to Jolt enemies or Hellion for solar scorching and kills. Facets of Courage, Balance, Dawn, Protection and Blessing play well - Balance returns melee energy on rapid light energy kills (which you'll be getting plenty of with Jolt or the Hellion mortar), Protection gives you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent), Blessing starts health regeneration on melee kills, powered melee hits from Dawn make you radiant for a +25% damage boost (and to pierce Barrier Champions with your weapons), and Courage increases light-based damage against darkness debuffed enemies (so more Jolt/Hellion damage against frozen/unravelled enemies).

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy written v8.0.5.1 (PvE PvE-MinorSpec PvE-God M+KB Controller): Want to feel even more safe in your rift? Stag and Vesper is a simple, proc-free combination to drop your rift while Ghost decrypts the same code its been working on for the last 10 years in the Devil's Lair, and gain x2 Resist for a damage reduction of -25% with Horn, and send out a regular arc shockwave to dissuade any meleeing enemies with nefarious intentions with Vesper. If you want to summon a personal army while you're there, the Hellion and Weaver's Call Aspects both proc on a rift cast. Arcane Needle gives you three melee charges which apply strand unravelling to enemies, and the grenade if dealer's choice - Healing Grenade if you want another source of healing, Coldsnap if you want a source of darkness debuff, or Storm or Vortex to damage enemies. Alongside those you might consider Facets of Sacrifice to generate bonus darkness transcendence energy from kills while you have light elemental buff, Devotion to grant bonus light transcendent energy ftom killing enemies debuffed by darkness debuffs, Hope to recover ability energy while you have an elemental buff, Purpose to provide an elemental buff on power orb pickup, and Protection to give you +15% DR in a crowd (+30% when Transcendent). You could swap out Devotion for Courage to provide bonus damage from light abilities to enemies with a darkness debuff, or Dominance to improve arc/void grenades.

The Riposte is the Final Shape expansion's Competitive playlist reward - a unique Lightweight frame AR which grants the usual +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed with the fire rate of a rapid-fire. Base stats equate to 24.00m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.30s ADS speed, 0.38s ready and 0.35s stow speed, and 1.79s reload speed, which compares well with the raid rapid-fire AR Rufus's Fury. Recoil is not great on controller, but stability barrel and mag perks can help, and you also get a choice of stocks that can assist too - Fitted Stock adds 20 Recoil Directions and 10 Stability for a small Handling loss. Aim to get to around 80 Stability, and you should be fine. If control isn't so much of an issue for you, then Short Action Stock or Composite Stock will boost Handling for a snappier gunfeel. For add-clearing, the void trait perk pairing of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds work really well together, and synergise with builds using void aspects and fragments.

Aisha's Care is the first heavy burst frame pulse rifle that sits in the kinetic slot, as a Strand weapon, but unfortunately the trait perks are mainly PvP focussed, with it being a Trials weapon. Base stats are excellent compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 37.40m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.05s reload speed. Saying that, handling and reload speed could definitely do with some help from the barrel and magazine perk slots. Slice is always useful in the first trait perk column when facing a boss, to apply Sever and reduce damage output by -40% - particularly running a Hunter. You can go all-in to Strand with Hatchling, and benefit from Strand aspect and fragment synergy for both perks - you should be getting plenty of easy crit kills to generate Threadlings, or boost damage output through Collective Action or Golden Tricorn.

Shapeable. Corrasion - the process of mechanical erosion by abrasion - is the arc member of the new meta pulse rifle - it looks good, and is easily available during Final Shape. Base stats are, as you'd expect, poor compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 36.76m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.12s reload speed. It fires slowly enough for recoil not to be too much of an issue, so you can focus on Handling and Reload Speed with the barrel and mag perks. Unusually, there's a damage perk in the first trait column - High-Impact Reserves, so you can double up damage multipliers in the second column with Frenzy for +15% and maxxed handling and reload speed. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the pulse rifle's decent damage multiplier and any damage bonus, so the initial explosion can be more damaging than a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

Shapeable. Corrasion - the process of mechanical erosion by abrasion - is the arc member of the new meta pulse rifle - it looks good, and is easily available during Final Shape. Base stats are, as you'd expect, poor compared to the small family of peers, and equate to 36.76m ADS range before damage dropoff, 0.39s ADS speed, 0.44s ready and 0.43s stow speed, and 2.12s reload speed. It fires slowly enough for recoil not to be too much of an issue, so you can focus on Handling and Reload Speed with the barrel and mag perks. If you're looking for a Voltshot roll, then you'll need a reload perk in the first trait column - Enlightened Action boosts handling and reload, although it might be more difficult to build stacks up if you're reloading constantly to proc Voltshot. Alternatively, Eddy Current pairs well if you're using a build using arc aspects and fragments to stay Amplified. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is extra AoE damage that inherits the pulse rifle's decent damage multiplier, so the initial explosion is as damaging as a special ammo Chain Reaction explosion - what's not to love?

"Ded Gramarye" translates as "dead" and "occult learning, magic, or enchantment" from archaic English so, necromancy, at a guess. First, the Wild Card origin trait works well on a shotgun, as the little energy bolts inherit its high combatant weapon scaling. The weapon itself has quite poor stats but it boasts some great, and unique, possible trait perk pairings. You can go with any barrel perk of your preference, other than Smoothbore or Rifled Barrel. Assault Mag and then Tactical Mag are the best of the magazine perks. As a slightly off-piste choice, the trait perk pairing of Discord and Chain Reaction - which is excellent on shotguns as the explosion damage also inherits the damage scaling - or Surrounded for +47% damage when enhanced, will allow you to get a kill with your other weapon, and then go on a tear for 7s refunding every killing shot fired. For a double special loadout, this is really useful for ammo economy. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Backup Mag mod.

"Suspectum" is a Latin adjective meaning "mistrusted" and - fun fact - is also the specific name for the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). In Destiny 2, this is a precision frame (so you can ignore recoil stats) stasis fusion rifle. The Veist Stinger origin trait, even post-nerf - is still handy for a partial reload and and gunfeel boosts. Try to improve handling a little with the barrel perk, and then in the battery perk slot, Ionized Battery plus Backup Mag is the only way to get to the maximum of 7 shots. That means, with three reserves mods and a fully procced Envious Assassin in the first trait column you'll have 21 shots of your 23 total in your battery (and if Veist Singer procs, you'll run out before reloading). You can't get Bait and Switch, but Firing Line's +20% damage in a fireteam is perfectly respectable and doesn't need reproccing, or Precision Instrument tops out at +25% per shot once you hit six crits in a row.

// The Call
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Rocket-Assisted Frames are not super strong in PvP. Slice allows you to sever your opponents and get a bit of a damage advantage. Beacon Rounds adds some flexibility in your shots as it adds in tracking. Strategist is gonna be best if you're using a high class ability build. In terms.of the fourth column, Adrenaline Junkie or Desperate Measures are both easy to get 20% damage or more with ability usage. While it's more of an on / off weapon where without a damage perk it does pretty whelming damage, once you get an ability kill it can allow you to roll over teams easier."

// Perfect Paradox
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Over in the crucible Perfect Paradox falls victim to its own frame. Rapid-Fire frame shotguns just don't have the stopping power to really compete. It's too easy to accidentally shoot twice and waste what little special you do have if you secure the OHK but will oftentimes deal just enough damage to two tap, requiring that second follow up shot and even a melee just to secure one kill. It's not worth the effort required in the current ammo economy." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Ionized Battery, Clown Cartridge and Reservoir Burst bring the magazine up to 11 (normally 7) allowing 5 continuous Reservoir Burst shots. While Voltshot is present on this fusion I didn’t find it as useful compared to a primary or special weapon." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "While lightweight frames are good for the faster mobility / dodge cooldown this one in particular can hold its own outside of being a good frame for the crucible. Dynamic Sway Reduction and Kill Clip are incredible for dueling and kill chaining together. I would like to see someone try and keep Chaos Reshaped up but I don’t think outside of top tier players it would come into play. Staying alive and in combat for that long is just difficult to do."

// Wild Style (First-choice PvE)

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 109 from 17 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nTeQvaqobDnHpu43iq8eH?si=091612d7b0604589) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors, Bosses and Champions in end-game actives. Wild Style has returned with a refreshed perk pool and has gone from meh to must have. If you get Disorientating Grenades as the magazine perk, this automatically reduces blast radius to 0 in which case just use the barrel perk to improve velocity and handling. This mag perk disorients enemies up to boss-tier, helping manage firefights with both large groups and more difficult individual adds. As the first column trait perk, Reconstruction is just a better Auto-Loading Holster, overfilling to 2 in the magazine, or Envious Assassin needs a bit more setup but can overflow the mag to 3 shots. Then, Vorpal Weapon in the second column provides a reliable +15% damage. The Tex Balanced Stock origin trait is probably the most useful of the three, unless there's a GL artifact mod in which case use Stunning Recovery. Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling mod.

Wanna fire the same Precision AR as Zavala? Origin Story returns with a refreshed (if huge) perk pool. If you're focussing make sure you've reset your reputation a few times first. The precision frame makes recoil easier to handle but the stats are on the low side, so you can use the barrel and magazine perks to fill them out a little. You've got a choice of first column support perks to add utility, boost gunfeel stats or directly improve reload speed. In the second column, Onslaught can dramatically improve outgoing damage as you're killing adds. Either Origin Trait can work, depending on whether you want a little bit of health or slightly improved gunfeel. The perk pool is huge, so reset Vanguard rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: any - dealer's choice, with a Backup Mag mod.

Scintillation (that is, the process of being sparkly) is the first Strand adaptive burst LFR. It's got decent stats and feels good to use, and the Veist Stinger, while not the powerhouse it once more, is still the best origin trait to have on an LFR. With this being a three shot burst, you'll imp[rove control with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk. The best battery perk is Enhanced Battery which, with a Backup Mag mod, is your first step towards the maximum 7 shots but, if you get Accelerated Coils that also works to improve DPS rate at the cost of a small drop to total damage. In the first trait column, Envious Assassin can triple your number of shots to 21 - pretty much all of your reserve ammo. In the second, Reservoir Burst is the final step to get to 7 shots in the base battery, adds +25% damage to every overflowed shot and, if you kill your target, the explosion is 4x stronger than Chain Reaction would be.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 109 from 17 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nTeQvaqobDnHpu43iq8eH?si=091612d7b0604589) with @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr (PvE / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor enemies in end-game content. Better Devils returns (again) as a strand adaptive hand cannon and, as you'd expect from a playlist weapon, the stats aren't good. However, the two trait perk columns have just about every PvE option you could ever want! And, you also have the choice of two reasonable origin traits to use as well. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out gunfeel stats. For end-game use, looking at first column trait perks that don't need a kill to proc and which further fill out the gunfeel stats Rapid Hit, Enlightened Action, Perpetual Motion all work. Air Trigger might be more of a PvP perk, but provides Outlaw-like reload speeds if you're off the ground. In the second column, One For All provides a +30% damage bonus for hitting three enemies, or Explosive Payload adds a little extra damage and flinch. The perk pool is huge, so reset Crucible rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

Better Devils returns (again) as a strand adaptive hand cannon and, as you'd expect from a playlist weapon, the stats aren't good. However, the two trait perk columns have just about every PvE option you could ever want! And, you also have the choice of two reasonable origin traits to use as well. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out gunfeel stats. For end-game use, looking at first column trait perks that don't need a kill to proc and which further fill out the gunfeel stats Rapid Hit, and Perpetual Motion Perpetual Motion both help add stability to pretty much max out gunfeel stats when paired with Frenzy, which also adds a useful +15% damage. The perk pool is huge, so reset Crucible rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

Better Devils returns (again) as a strand adaptive hand cannon and, as you'd expect from a playlist weapon, the stats aren't good. However, the two trait perk columns have just about every PvE option you could ever want! And, you also have the choice of two reasonable origin traits to use as well. Use the barrel and mag perks to round out gunfeel stats. For strand fragment synergy, Slice is very useful in the first trait perk column in end-game content to reduce an outgoing enemy's damage - probably most useful on a Hunter. In the second column, Hatchling further synergises with Strand, or look for a damage boosting trait perk like One For All, Frenzy or Explosive Payload.

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy: (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-MajorSpec / PvE-BossSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss enemies. Scintillation (that is, the process of being sparkly) is the first Strand adaptive burst LFR. It's got decent stats and feels good to use, and the Veist Stinger, while not the powerhouse it once more, is still the best origin trait to have on an LFR. With this being a three shot burst, you'll improve control with Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk. The best battery perk is Ionized Battery which, with a Backup Mag mod, is your only way to the maximum 7 shots but, if you get Accelerated Coils that also works to improve DPS rate at the cost of a small drop to total damage. In the first trait column, a reload or battery extending perk is a must-have for a sustained damage roll. In the second, if you don't already have the niche roll that works on a boss when enemies are near (think the Ir Yût encounter in Crota's end), Surrounded adds +40% damage (+47% when enhanced).

The re-reprised Warden's Law was the first of the heavy burst subfamily, and provides good, if slightly clunky-feeling damage. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both also do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. Using Tactical Mag or Appended Mag as the magazine perk, with a Backup Mag mod, will bring the magazine to its maximum of 14. In the first trait column as the support perk, Demolitionist has been added - ideal for grenade builds. Then in the second, you can go all-in with Adrenaline Junkie for a damage boost, or there's Frenzy to maximise handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage. The Vanguard's Vindication origin trait is useful, if not very noticeable. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

Use the barrel - Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel make the recoil direction almost perfect and boost stability or range, and you can recover the lost handling with trait perks - and mag perks to round out gunfeel stats. For end-game use, looking at first column trait perks that don't need a kill to proc and which further fill out the gunfeel stats Rapid Hit, Enlightened Action, Perpetual Motion all work. Air Trigger might be more of a PvP perk, but provides Outlaw-like reload speeds if you're off the ground. In the second column, One For All provides a +30% damage bonus for hitting three enemies, or Explosive Payload adds a little extra damage and flinch. The perk pool is huge, so reset Crucible rank as many times as you can before you start focusing engrams. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod.

Claws of the Wolf returns in season 24 with a largely new (largely PvP-focussed) perk pool, but with stats the look a bit anaemic by comparison with its peers.

In the magazine perk slot, you could either look to fill out the stats a little more, or get a combat effect mag perk. If you don't already have an Elsie's Rifle with the void combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds in the two trait perk columns, then this roll can synergise with void fragments to boost the subclass verbs and provide a void overshield while clearing groups of adds.

In the magazine perk slot, for a niche roll to tuck away for when Pulse Rifles have an anti-barrier artifact mod, Armor-Piercing Rounds do 5% extra damage to barriers, and enemy shields. There's not really much choice in the first trait column other than Perpetual Motion, which does fill out the gunfeel stats nicely, and then Disruption Break in the second column boosts kinetic damage by +50% after piercing the barrier, which should make clean-up easy.

Shapeable. Veiled Threat looks lovely (like Vex Mytholast had a baby!) but unfortunately drops with poor base stats compared to its peers, so if you have a Krait you're happy with you can probably pass on by. If you're shooting adds at the outer reach of its range (22.6m at base), you might appreciate a little extra stability on controller, otherwise maybe a bit of extra range or stability with the barrel perk. In the mag slot, Alloy Mag can double down on the intrinsic frame perk to reduce reload time from 1.83s to 1.24s when empty, or Tactical Mag (1.68s) or Flared Magwell (1.61s) work at any point in the magazine if you can't wait. There's an interesting interaction between Shoot to Loot in the first trait perk column and the Radiolaria Transposer origin trait when procced - any ammo caught in the pool will be picked up. In the second, to boost damage, Desperate Measures adds up to +30% or Collective Action adds a flat +20%, and both are easy to proc with Transcendence. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like?

Shapeable. Lost Signal is the first of a new special grenade launcher "area denial" subfamily which, from this example, has promise. You can think of this as a baby Witherhoard or a stasis flamethrower, firing five projectiles per shot that form flame pools where they hit something (even in the air). Use the barrel perk to boost handling and velocity - Quick Launch is best with Smart Drift Control as a second choice, and High-Velocity Rounds is the best of the two magazine perks. In the first trait column, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses the need to worry about reload speed, or Stats for All can boost Handling and Reload Stats to 100. In the second, as the raw AoE damage isn't huge, One for All can easily boost damage by a hefty +35% and all the damage ticks are great for recovering darkness Transcendence energy.

The stats are towards the bottom of comparators although on the plus side, with the frame intrinsic, at least you don't have to worry about recoil direction. Handling could definitely do with a boost from the barrel perk - Fluted Barrel is best, with maybe Corkscrew Rifling instead if that's all the drops. For Voltshot, Reload Speed is key, which is a poor 2.54s at base - hence Flared Magwell (2.29s), or Tactical Mag (2.37s) as the magazine perk and, in the first trait perk column, Enlightened Action. You get three stacks per hit, so four hits will grant +50 Handling and Reload Speed for 2s, reducing reload time to 1.83s. Finally, in the second trait slot, the perk you've been building towards, Voltshot, for fast add-clearing and synergising with arc fragments that use Jolt.

To use with Bipod in the second trait perk slot, Field Prep is the best first column trait perk - when enhanced, you only need one Void reserves mod to get to the maximum total of 17 ammo, and crouching shaves a second or so when reloading. Alternatively, Clown Cartridge reloads three in the mag each time, or Auto-Loading Holster just works to have a rocket ready when you need it. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag mod.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies episode 106 from 3 July 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7jGtQ3pw94PV7XpXREQ094?si=ddb5fb64813048e1) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects (PvE / PvE-Boss / PvE-Champion / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): First-choice PvE pick for stunning Overload Champions. Shapeable. Ill Omen is the first Stasis Caster from sword that can drop Cold Steel - which is potentially exciting for being able to disrupt Overload champions from a distance... except at the point of reviewing this weapon, in practice it's very inconsistent. To keep or craft one in the hope this bug gets fixed, you'll want to maximise ammo rather than damage with the Blade perk. For the guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit to everything and then, although there's not much that pairs with Cold Steel projectile attacks in the first trait perk column, Unrelenting, Relentless Strikes or Tireless Blade might be occasionally useful. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like? Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag mod.

// Episode 1, Act 1 weapons

//notes:Adamsdown_Boy (PvE / PvE-Solo / PvE-MinorSpec / PvE-EndGame / PvE-God / M+KB / Controller): PvE pick for add clearing in end-game content, particularly with solar fragments. Shapeable. Timeworn Wayfarer is the first solar aggressive frame rifle, which are easily outpaced by rapid-fires for DPS output, due to the long reload animation. It's got lowish stats but, like all of its peers, if you're running solo content and plinking away from a safe distance this offers near-adaptive hand cannon damage against adds at ranges up to around 70m. With it being slow firing, the reticule should have time to settle between shots, but you can improve gunfeel a little with Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk. Reload speed also needs some love, so Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or, if you have the discipline to not reload prematurely, Alloy Mag are best for your mag perk. There's not a huge choice for the first trait perk - reload is a bit slow for Heal Clip, so Dual Loader (especially when enhanced) speeds things up. For add-clear, Incandescent in the second column can be used with solar fragments for clearing groups of adds. The Radiolaria Transposer origin trait is nice to have - the AoE damage isn't huge, but it is additional to weapon damage so what's not to like?

Faith-Keeper isn't meta for boss damage, doing 10% less damage than Adaptives and Aggressives but having higher reserves at base. You get intrinsic tracking, which responds well to low velocity - giving more time to require if your target jinks out of the way - so Confined Launch is the optimum barrel perk.

Alternatively, Clown Cartridge reloads three in the mag each time, or Auto-Loading Holster just works to have a rocket ready when you need it.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits (there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up) which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. The first and second trait column perks can double down on the frame intrinsic perks through Physic which grants x1 Restoration (x2 when enhanced) for 5s to both you and allies when procced, and Circle of Life which boosts damage on healing by an additional +25% for 10s (+37.5% total for the first 5s with the Support Frame Boost) for both you and the healed Guardian. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have (who doesn't love more super energy?) - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

// (Quick Launch, Volatile Launch, Linear Compensator), (Tactical Mag, High-Velocity Rounds), Slice, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35) with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for a Bait and Switch rotation for sustained boss DPS in end-game content. Shapeable. The Call is the best weapon to come from the Pale Heart weapon set. There's only one other rocket-assisted frame, so there's not much to compare against, but the stats don't honestly matter. You'd normally look for velocity in a non-hitscan weapon, but there's an argument to be made for blast radius too so the barrel and mag perk choices depend on your preference. As a niche roll in a boss fight, a Hunter could include this in a Bait and Switch weapon rotation, dodging to reload a power weapon, swapping and then applying Slice as the first trait column perk to reduce boss damage output. You're not going to be getting a damage boost from any other source in the middle of a damage phase, so Vorpal Weapon in the second column at least gives you +15% damage just for firing at a boss. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have (who doesn't love more super energy?) - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for burst DPS against Majors and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. Someday has in-band stats and is the only kinetic precision frame shotgun currently available. As per usual, Look for handling, or a touch of extra range (without any penalties) in the barrel perk, and Assault Mag (or maybe Tactical Mag) in the magazine slot. As the support perk in the first trait column, Threat Detector and Lead for Gold are viable options, or the new Threat Remover looks interesting. Then in the second column, this is the only non-Raid shotgun, and the first pellet shotgun, that can roll with Recombination, which adds up to +100% damage to the next shot, ideal for tanky enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for backup DPS against Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you don't already have a fusion rifle for backup DPS, Axial Lacuna is available and shapeable. If you're interested, a lacuna is a gap or blank space, so the name refers to something missing in the direction of an axis. Improve your handling with your barrel perk, and then with your battery, Accelerated Coils is probably the top choice, but there's also something to be said for the extra shots you'll get from Enhanced Battery. there's nothing better than Reconstruction in the first trait perk slot, doubling your battery's capacity for a damage phase. In the second trait slot, Controlled Burst is the go-to trait for bonus damage, both adding +20% damage and reducing charge time for just landing all your bolts.

It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the barrel perk to provide help with control and a little extra handling.

For sustained damage, in the first trait perk column, choose between Reconstruction for an effortless overflowed mag or Envious Assassin for a potentially bigger overflowed mag that needs add kills.

// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag), Heal Clip, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling and then, unusually, Sticky Grenades is the top mag perk for this particularl roll (bear with us). Either Field Prep or Cascade Point and Deconstruct together make this a great DPS choice. Either just take advantage of two extra reserve ammo and faster reload and handling from Field Prep, or proc Cascade Point with a couple of sniper crits and to proc the higher fire rate, while Deconstruct with Sticky Grenades pulls bonus ammo out of the air on every second, rather than every third, hit because of the delay before the explosive damage. This extends your effective magazine size to 11, but only using 6 ammo. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw) with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Slammer is our first vortex frame Stasis sword, with the same stats as its peers. Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. For add clearing, the trait perk combination, that's unique to The Slammer, of Chain Reaction and Cold Steel spreads slow stacks (which you can improve with Stasis subclass fragments) with the add kill explosions and, when enhanced, Cold Steel also adds a useful 10 to the inventory stat for additional ammo reserves. You'll probably find more use for the Vanguard's Vindication origin trait, unless there's a champion mod around for swords that works with Stunning Recovery.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column.

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction."

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities.

Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

Blast Furnace does have a leg up over recent additions with the combination of Zen Moment and Kill Clip for easy follow-up two burst kills. Outside of S16 Messenger (which might not be possible due to the perk updates) no other aggressive frame pulse has that combination. (Elsie's Rifle also gets this combo but we will talk about that later). Another lethal combo is Headseeker and Kill Clip which allows for double damage, the only other pulse to get this combination is Chattering Bone." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:controller,pvp

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If you were to take a roll into the Crucible, I would recommend Moving Target or Explosive Payload in the third column. Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// The Recluse (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse’s defining trait, Master of Arms, being brought down to a 15% damage buff makes it more manageable as a weapon and less dominant in PvE and PvP. Instead you could opt for consistency perks like Dynamic Sway Reduction, or Tap the Trigger. Threat Detector and Hip-Fire Grip are both excellent but have more limiting use cases; distance and non-ADS respectively. Desperate Measures is a better lethality perk as it can activate while stowed, so once you get a grenade or melee kill it lets you relive the 20% damage bonus of pre-nerf Master of Arms."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles).

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "If you were to take a roll into the Crucible, I would recommend Moving Target or Explosive Payload in the third column. Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

// Succession (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I understand Bungie wants players to get a taste of the raid weapons to get players to buy the expansions and then play the raids, but Heritage is arguably a better Deep Stone Crypt weapon that doesn't infringe on other weapon types. Nevertheless, there are not many rolls you will be farming for. Reconstruction will give you more ammo in your magazine by rebuilding itself over time. Pair that with either Vorpal Weapon or Recombination for some high damage shot(s). Firing Line is great if you can link up with teammates to get the extra damage."

Heal Clip and Incandescent are fantastic together and allow you to push out your engagement ranges a bit further because it’s a pulse rifle.

// The Summoner (Adept)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "PvP has far less options but still some solid options. Instead of different niches within the grand scheme of PvE content, we really have consistency or lethality 2x. Within both you’ll find a healthy scoop of stability perks, either Zen Moment, Dynamic Sway Reduction, or Perpetual Motion. Pick your poison there. If you want more consistency on top of your consistency sundae, go for Tap the Trigger. For lethality you can opt for Target Lock, Onslaught, or the tried and true Kill Clip. All options are great but work in different ways, your best option might not be the same as others so give them a try." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,controller

A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help.

The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced.

If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age.

You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

In CQC you'll probably find the Overshield damage reduction really useful anyway, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. Parabellum has decent stats and a nice clean sight picture. Round out the range, stability and recoil direction stats to your preference with the barrel perk. You're looking for a snappy reload, so Alloy Mag is the best mag perk choice, but the stability from Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell make Parabellum easier to control. Heal Clip in the first trait column and Frenzy in the second work well - Frenzy boosts reload speed (and handling) to 100 anyway as well as adding a +15% damage boost. The fast reload, means it's easier to proc Cure from Heal Clip, which you can use with Ember of Benevolence on a solar subclass. The Field-Tested origin trait is a slow burn but, if you can stay alive, the stacks do build up to have a pretty significant impact on the gunfeel stats.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. With one eye on Bipod as the second column trait, as there's no Field Prep option, you'll start off with 2 in the mag and 12 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to five in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 4 in the tube at the rate of one every 4s, or Clown Cartridge provides 3 or 4 after a manual reload. For burst and sustained Boss damage, Bipod just about breaks even with 25% less damage and slower reloads, but faster firing and more reserve ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Uzume RR4 has very nice stats in it's subfamily, but the 50 zoom is either a blessing or a curse, depending on your viewpoint. Either way this is only worth keeping if you don't have a decent solar sniper, or it's better than the one you're replacing. The recoil direction of 75 is vertical, but if you're firing repeatedly at a crit spot it's still a good idea to control it with a boost to recoil direction or additional stability from your barrel perk. Handling is always nice to have too. Appended Mag gets you an extra shot - you can also use Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell to boost reload speed as your mag perk instead. In the first trait column as the support park, Fourth Time's The Charm or Clown Cartridge are pretty much tied - if you can reliably hit crits, FttC might get you an extra shot more reliably before reloading. In the second as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon is the best of the bunch for a permanently-on +15% against Major Spec and Boss Spec enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies, or Boss spec enemies with short damage windows in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives. For this roll, you'll be looking to block damage, so a Guard perk like Burst Guard or Balanced Guard works best. This is the only sword dropping in S23 with the combination of Flash Counter and Counterattack - get in close to a tanky enemy to bait them into a melee/slam attack, and then the combination of weaken and bonus damage provides +80% damage for 2s, and +20% for the next two, which should be enough time to put a serious dent in their health bar. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun.

For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor spec enemies in general content. Incisor (Adept) may be the chase playlist activity weapon for S23, being the first legendary strand trace rifle - possibly worth the pain of Trials for! Excellent stats plus the Alacrity origin trait for solo play start us off. Recoil Direction is 94, so you don't need to worry too much. Handling and stability are both useful in a barrel perk. For the battery perk, we want as many charges as we can, so watch for Ionized or Enhanced Battery. For a backup weapon to use against bosses, Envious Assassin can load a ridiculous 260 charges in your battery after 15 kills with other weapons, which means you can reach the upper +40% stack of Target Lock's damage boost with sustained fire against a target. This works well for a Warlock running Cenotaph Mask to drop heavy ammo for a fireteam.

First-choice PvE pick for damage against vehicles and constructs in end-game content. Belisarius-D (Belisarius isn't a dinosaur, but rather a 5th Century Byzantine general) has strong stats but, like all Aggressive Burst pulse rifles, suffers poor handling and reload speed. Arrowhead Brake adds handling and corrects the recoil direction to 100 or Fluted Barrel gives the highest handling bump as the barrel perk. Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. For a unique roll - something to add to a collection, just in case you ever need it - Vorpal Weapon is in the first trait column(!), so if you pair it with Deconstruct in the second and Hakke Breach Armaments as the origin trait, with a Boss Spec mod, and that's every perk available that provides additional damage against vehicles and constructs.

Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. The traits are mostly PvP flavoured but Slice and Hatchling in the first and second trait columns work together as a weapon to synergise with Strand subclass fragments - this could make it a good option as part of a Bait and Switch rotation with Slice reducing outgong damage from a major boss by 40% when procced - or alternatively, Rapid Hit and Keep Away, again in the first column bump up gunfeel stats.

Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve.

First-choice PvE pick for bulkier Minor spec add clearing in general content, particularly with an arc subclass. Shapeable. Scalar Potential has decent stats and a nice clean scope, but you're limited by a PvP trait perk pool. Arrowhead Brake is probably the best barrel perk, although you could imrpve handling or range if you can handle the recoil direction. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are then the pick of the mag perks. As the support perk in the first trait column, Enlightened Action boosts both handling and reload speed by 50 after five hits. In the second column as the signature perk, your arc abilities should make the second stack of Golden Tricorn easy to proc for +50% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit.

// Volatile Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, Field Prep, Bipod
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. Like other High-Impact Rocket Launchers with their high blast radius, Sleepless really only has one role, and that's add clearing - maybe for Gunsmith bounties. You might be better off waiting until you can craft a Semiotician with enchanced versions of the traits, but if you can't wait, maximise the Blast Radius with Volatile Launch and Black Powder in the barrel and mag, and a Blast Radius Masterwork to start with. You might as well have as many rockets to shoot as you can, so Field Prep boosts your reserves and helps with reload speed, as the first trait perk to support Bipod - with all of this you'll have 15 rockets loading two at a time that still have 90 Blast Radius and a decent reload speed when crouched. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Blast Radius, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

Fragile Focus is great for starting an engagement but will quickly lose its value the longer you’re in a gunfight. Moving Target is neutrally good for providing a better strafe speed and some much needed aim assist.

Envious Assassin is great for overfilling the magazine, and Vorpal Weapon will net you great damage. You can utilize the full extent of Precision Instrument, my biggest issue is the frame. Rapid-fire frame snipers are hard to utilize at max RPM and require a hard pull down to keep on target.

// Vouchsafe
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Lightweight frames in PvP are in an interesting spot. They don’t kill fast enough to be competitive, and any boosts don’t really elevate the weapon further. Golden Tricorn 2x does allow you to 3 shot any guardian at any resilience at a 0.60 TtK, but it requires two whole kills to get rolling and without additional ability kills you’ll be back at square one before you know it.

// Scatter Signal
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh hey, a new strand fusion rifle. Will Scatter Signal be better than Pressurized Precision? Well neither are great as Strand fusion rifles. But for a “Kinetic” fusion rifle I think Scatter Signal rivals and possibly beats out Riptide for best in slot fusion. Overflow and Controlled Burst for added damage throughout the magazine. You’ll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase. If you opt for Extended Battery for the 16 total shots you can slot in Major or Boss spec for an additional 7.77% damage to every shot." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred.

Eye of the Storm is conditional in that you will have to take damage, but the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. In the crucible you will be taking damage, so getting some extra benefits alongside that is all upsides. Kill Clip doesn’t change the time to kill enough to be noticeable unless you hit nothing but headshots. In which case you’ll drop down to a 0.60 TtK with 6 crits on Tier 8 Resilience or below.

So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you’ll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we’re back to square one.

// Undercurrent (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Forbearance, Salvager’s Salvo, or Undercurrent. Which is going to reign supreme? Probably Forbearance. But Undercurrent is a decent attempt. Voltshot isn’t as significant as Chain Reaction and only works on the first hit of subsequent shots. Bait and Switch is interesting for keeping up damage but not having a reliable magazine overflow perk hurts a bit more. Ambitious Assassin is great, but Envious is better. Overall I’d say it’s a neat addition but you wouldn’t be too hurt not having it if you already have Forbearance or Salvo." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Indebted Kindness
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Indebted Kindness is extremely interesting in the crucible. Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn’t incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn’t rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Dragoncult Sickle
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Dragoncult Sickle is our last dungeon weapon. Being a strand caster frame might actually benefit the toolkit a bit more. Being able to spread Sever through Slice and Chain Reaction or spawn Threadlings from a distance makes this weapon an incredibly strong addition to an all Strand loadout. It might not be the best for boss damage or the best for add clear, but I think it will find a nice home in some Strand loadouts." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this and then the SOFA (Stats/ One For All) combination of trait perks to round out the stats further and add a chunky 35% bonus damage. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10sand grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s (although you can interact with any elemental drop).

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of bulkier Minor, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can bypass that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and Champions in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. But it has a trick that now other sword can do - the Cold Steel trait perk. For single target damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. As your trait perk combination, both Relentless Strikes and Cold Steel proc off three hits, with the first two Cold Steel hits Stasis slowing and the third hit freezing enemies. That covers Overload and Unstoppable Champions. Throw on Radiant from a solar subclass to cover Barriers too, and you have the sword equivalent of Riptide which will freeze lock Majors with every third hit, and which you can apply Stasis subclass fragments too as well.

// Zephyr (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For add clearing, it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for add clearing, the a mag boosting blade slot perk keeps you slashing for longer. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes return ammo, or Unrelenting recovers health. In the second, you could use Chain Reaction for the explosions to help clear adds, or Surrounded or Collective Action for additional damage to help clear bulkier Minor spec and the occasional Major spec enemies. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows.

As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Precision Instrument in the second could make for an interesting combination to apply Sever to majors and bosses from range - even when they're immune to damage - to reduce their damage output by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity (effectively a 40% DR for the whole fireteam) as well as doing decent, for a primary weapon, damage with the boost from Precision Instrument.

The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Collective Action in the second makes this a bit of a Swiss-army knife of weapons. Slice, with Strand of Continuity, Severs an enemy to reduce their damage output by 40% for 15s - you can use this effect on Majors and Bosses, even during an immunity phase to grant an effective 40% damage reduction for your whole fireteam. Or, apply Sever to a minor and kill it to spawn a Tangle that you can use with Collective Action for a 20% damage boost for 7s, then rinse and repeat.

First-choice PvE pick for against Major or Boss Spec enemies, particularly with Strand subcalsses, in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception, having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice, taking the stat to a manageable 84. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag (seven) as Appended and Extended Mag, but either of those work too. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively, while Slice in the second trait makes this possibly the best special weapon to pair with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon - reducing the Severed target's damage output by 40% for 10s (15s with Thread of Continuity if you're using a Strand subclass) - an effective additional 40% DR for your whole fireteam.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't.

The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second.

//notes:Stallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Unfortunately, Zephyr would not be my first pick for PvP swords. Its not craftable, Cold Steel is pointless and its not an interesting frame. BUT. This would be what I'd take into PvP if I had to. Duelist benefits the player after a kill until you put the sword away, but since heavy is not very frequent in PvP, you're likely gonna commit to using all your ammo up. So Duelist gives the best benefit in slot imo. Vorpal is a nice safety net incase your heavy spawn gets assaulted by a super (I've seen it happen, it's terrifying), you might be able to fight back a little easier."

Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85.

For me, there's an undeniable good feel when it comes to 450s, I love using them but finding a way to best make use of them typically comes down to how I can nuke the most trash mobs in the fastest time. In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag improves rate-of-fire or Tactical Mag increases the magazine by one and boosts reload speed. With a shotgun, you're going to be in CQC to proc Threat Detector as the first trait column support perk, to boost reload speed and handling or you could use Subsistence to continually reload your magazine as you get kills, if you're using this more for add-clear rather than single-target damage. The same CQC condition will proc Surrounded for a +40% (47% on Enhanced Surrounded) boost to damage to help clear the most subborn Minor and Major enemies, and help with the occasional Boss. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing chunkier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Barrel and Mag re-shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag increases rate-of-fire, which is always useful. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second, Golden Tricorn can help you make the most of the Strand melee abilities (you're going to be in CQC, with a shotgun), setting yourself up for +50% damage for chunkier minors and the occasional major, and Cursed Thrall explosions on a kill.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The only other current lightweight SMG is Submission (which is a stat monster), so Showrunner's stats look a bit poor by comparison, but there are still some interesting PvE rolls worth considering. Lightweights give you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed as the frame bonus to start. You can push out the range with the barrel perk - Hammer Forged Rifling or Smallbore both work well, and Ricochet Rounds pushes out the range a bit further and adds a bit more stability. There are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded and, once you've done that you can collect any generated elemental pickups to proc Collective Action (which is unusual to see on a Kinetic weapon) for a 20% damage boost. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

For melee-focussed builds, in the first trait column as the support perk, there are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded or you can use Grave Robber to keep your mag topped up to make the most of Swashbuckler in the second, signature perk slot for 33% bonus damage.

Start by straightening up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and then add one of the combat effect rounds - Ricochet also adds stability, but they are all useful. In the first trait column as the support park, either Enlightened Action boosts reload speed and handling to maximum in two 3-round bursts, or Outlaw maximises reload and applies a scalar.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts.

If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

// Qua Xaphan V - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "There are not many uses for a high-impact machine gun in PvP. They require all crits but just feel extremely unforgiving. Anything to bump up the consistency will be greatly appreciated. Dynamic Sway Reduction or Under Pressure, and Ricochet Rounds will feel great. Rampage might not be the best but it does allow you to 3 crit 1 body any resilience and 2 crit 2 body all the way up to 7 resilience. Adrenaline Junkie isn't quite as strong on the low end. But if you can get a grenade kill you can 3 crit any resilience for a 0.33s TtK. Incredibly fast." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:controller,pvp

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Deadpan Delivery is a great shotgun for most players looking for a "plug and play" shotgun. Being able to have Overflow and One-Two Punch for the highest damage show followed by the most One-Two Punch... punches. The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with. Barrel Constrictor is an interesting perk for PvE as it makes sure all your pellets hit but it would be better paired with One-Two Punch instead of in the same column."

// Deadpan Delivery - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "I'm not going to lie. I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range. Bungie knew what they were doing when bringing in this weapon as Deadpan Delivery has the second lowest range stat of all Aggressive Frame shotguns even losing to the Uncommon Ded Nemoris II."

Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon."

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

// Nightshade - Controller PvP (controller,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Nightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on. With my roll choices you can have 100 recoil direction with a counterbalance mod and 32m of in game range. Plenty to take advantage of the bonuses of Keep Away."

I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

// Oversoul Edict - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Did anyone ask for more rapid-fire frame pulses? It wasn’t on my Bingo card. Either way Oversoul Edict is here and requires Arrowhead Brake in order to even shoot reliably. Even with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance Stock you’ll be just shy of perfect at 94 recoil direction. Definitely great, but it’s a shame you’ll have to sacrifice a mod to make it feel like it’s shooting where you point it. In PvE Oversoul Edict doesn’t have the best reload perks. Keep Away and Precision Instrument are both great, Demolitionist can be strong on grenade heavy builds. The reason why I want a good reload perk like Outlaw or Rapid Hit is because of Voltshot. Being able to clear rooms with Voltshot is becoming more and more fun, but having to reload to get the zaps is less fun." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

You can choose a variety of different perks, you only need one handling perk and Threat Detector to hit 100 handling with an animation scalar, meaning you can invest the rest of your perks into range. Going with Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, and Opening Shot puts you at 91 range and 100 handling. Or you can opt for 100 range and 91 handling by swapping a few things around.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. But then if you add Bipod as your second column signature perk, you can end up with 15 total rockets, which should be plenty for a damage phase, and Field Prep more than offsets the reload penalty. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies, or burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base.

For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Enhanced Explosive Light as the second column signature perk gives you 7 rockets with a 25% damage boost for the low, low costs of just picking up orbs - good for both burst and sustained damage. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're leaning into the high blast radius and plan to use a rocket launcher for add clear (that way lies a jacket with wraparound sleeves, but you do you!), max out both the blast radius and bopost velocity with Volatile Launch and High-Velocity Rounds. Enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Then Hatchling as the second column signature perk adds Threadlings to the mix to extend your damage to adds outside the blast radius. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

The automatic 100 handling allows me to do WHATEVER I want to the detriment of handling, because it will ALWAYS be 100. So I can run Extended Barrel to bump my Recoil Direction to 85 and my range up 10, without any drawbacks of handling like I normally would... I suggest running this one of two different ways.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don’t think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bug-Out Bag
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(900) Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Chattering Bone
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Lightweight Frame(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Chattering Bone is showing its best footing yet. From a niche but underwhelming raid weapon to arguably the best in its archetype. Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone’s utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don’t know if the two of those perks would work together. It might be a case of the curated where you have damage that starts at the top half and once that goes away you have damage by the bottom half." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Different Times
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Strand Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability. Which puts Multikill Clip as the best damage perk." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"I don’t think Epochal Integration is a great example of a World Drop, but it is from Neumona. I guess that counts, right? Epochal Integration is a set roll, so it makes my life a lot easier. Incandescent and Stats for All are your choices for PvE, you can proc Stats for All after one explosion kill, if that explosion tags two more enemies. In regular activities this is often and makes Epochal Integration feel amazing, the issue is you cannot refresh Stats for all, and when it does go away it makes the gun feel 1/4 as good." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

You will certainly want to bump up the mag to at least 5 in order to take some advantage of it. Envious Assassin can also help you out here as both perks require other weapon kills to activate. The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot.

"Last Rite is very much a solid Ritual Weapon. It doesn’t exist as an incredibly strong scout, but it does come with a solid set of perks. Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man’s Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that’s necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It’s certainly one of the scouts of all time." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Old Sterling
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(600) Strand Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "It’s interesting to see the old Scathelocke model being used. I know many vets who loved this auto and I can’t blame them. Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today’s world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus’s Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds. The extra damage from the Threadlings are nice, but don’t pack as much of a punch without Strand to buff them." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Flared Magwell would be good for the stat bump and reload speed. Feeding Frenzy is the best for not needing precision hits, but Outlaw is great in the event that you can handle the bounce. Kill Clip is an easy 25%, but you could also opt for solar grenade builds with Demolitionist, or Dragonfly for some better add clear." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

My favorite little scout-auto love child. This time with random rolls!!! I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don’t even really care about viability, it will just be fun." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Aggressive Frame(750) Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You’re going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Tyranny of Heaven
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Draw Time. Lightweight Frame(580) Solar Combat Bow Primary Ammo.  "Tyranny of Heaven used to be the only solar bow in the game, and its sights are really odd. In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks. Incandescent does give you some great AoE but I find that not bumping up the bow’s innate damage might feel a bit lackluster in higher end activities." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range. High-Impact Frame(960) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "In PvP Controlled Burst will be great for going on those streaks but we haven’t seen many fusion rifles with Eye of the Storm. Dreambreaker was the first and then came Glacioclasm, but we haven’t seen Eye of the Storm on an adept fusion before. Making this a really strong contender for being the most consistent high-impact fusion in the game. Under Pressure or Firmly Planted paired with Eye of the Storm will give you huge amounts of consistency. Maybe a better 3v3 weapon compared to Controlled Bursts 6v6 focus." |tags:pvp,controller

"In PvP you’ll find a lot of Guardians opting for the tried and true Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot Combo.

Almost making this the fastest sniper in the game, but certainly one with both Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot at the same time. The Supremacy can also reach 92, but that’s on a rapid-fire frame. Defiance of Yasmin (Harrowed) can reach 82 but that is with adept mods. Silicon Neuroma (Adept) is the highest aggressive frame at 59. On an adaptive sniper, this is the highest handling you can get without using things like Dragon’s Shadow, Ophidians, or even Slickdraw." |tags:pvp,controller

The only way to one shot a guardian in PvP is by stacking 3 surge mods with Swashbuckler, or getting Golden Tricorn 2x going.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist (which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw), or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

You'll need stability on a controller, so start with a stability barrel and a Stability masterwork. In the mag, the Combat Effect perks all provide utility. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk, and Frenzy in the second column as your signature perk.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and minor add clear in general content. Shapeable. Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. While the Recoil Direction is terrible, we'll control that with one of the traits. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore help fill in a combination of handling, stability or range. Flared Magwell further fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. To help control the recoil, Heating Up adds both stability and recoil direction after a kill to make this very easy to use, and pair will with Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk, for Strand subclass synergy. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

Overflow is laughably good on a special weapon, as a first trait column support park, doubling the magazine size just for picking up an ammo brick, even when stowed.

For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow.

Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. This is the only scout rifle you can roll with Rampage and Kill Clip together which, when procced together, add 66.4% damage - possibly one that's more for memes, but it could still be fun.

Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use).

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Techeun Force (however Saint Kabr pronounces it...) is reprised looking good. The stats to start are pretty good, although the recoil direction needs some attention, so Arrowhead Brake will take that to a controllable 90. Enhanced Battery then takes you to the maximum battery size. If you've not already got an arc-based Golden Tricorn fusion rifle, then look for Rewind Rounds, Reconstruction or Envious Assassin in the first trait slot as your support perk, to help with your uptime, and then Golden Tricorn is great for a reliable 15% refreshable damage bump up that goes up to a chunky 50% with an arc ability kill.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well). Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. High-Impact Rocket Launchers are meant for add-clear - they have the highest blast radius stat of the subfamilies and do middling damage - 10% less than Adaptives or Aggressives. And saying that, BrayTech Osprey has the worst stats in its subfamily. But there might be an interesting roll for burst damage worth looking at anyway. Increase the velocity stat with the barrel and masterwork - Quick Launch and Hard Launch are the best options, and Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage. In the first trait column as the support perk, for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against a Boss, Field Prep for the extra reserves, which means you only have to run two reserves mods for the maximum number of rockets, and have the reload speed boost when crouched. In the second trait slot as the signature perk, Bipod could be very interesting - two in the mag, even with the loss of damage being offset by less need to reload. Maybe one to keep, just in case.

In the first trait column for the support perk, Threat Detector, Surplus (particularly easy to maintain with the extra melee charges from Strand), or Perpetual Motion will bump gunfeel stats up. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For the magazine perk, any of the "Rounds" mags or Flared Magwell work well. For your first trait column support perk, Rapid Hit and Perpetual Motion can both layer on addition gunfeel boosts on top. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Finally, in the second slot, for non-endgame content, Desperado can be fun, increasing your DPS output by 30% for 6s by reloading after a crit kill. Recommended MW: any will work, depending on your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, and Unstoppable Force as the second column signature perk is a natural pairing, boosting damage by 20% for blocking the same damage with your shield.

Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw.

I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon.

Scouts have such good coverage that they can handle a slight hit to range in favor of landing more shots quickly.

Subsistence is also good if you’re in lower tiered PvE. Frenzy is the best in slot perk with either third column perk.

We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Lightweight(20) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Ninja swords go! Having access to Valiant Charge in the third column makes this the sword to come up in a while. It's unfortunate that Goldtusk is hunter specific as getting Valiant Charge with another great add clearing perk like Chain Reaction gives this sword no choice between movement or add clear. One for All is also great for dealing better shatter damage against bosses." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Unlike the last few this is truly a reprised version. Jorum’s Claw is a fun pulse that needs Arrowhead Brake to even be considered useful. In PvE you really don’t have a lot of choice. Outlaw and Arrowhead Brake are required. A mag extending perk is useful but not required. Frenzy does limit the need for outlaw but there aren’t really a lot of perks in that column I would take.

I don’t know about you but I sometimes prefer just a good reload perk. Threat Detector and Surrounded will make quick work of just about any horde mode, but falls off as soon as you’re out of combat.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): Recommended MW: Range. Aggressive(55) Kinetic Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Most Crucible players should rejoice over this shotgun returning. The issue lies in its competition. Imperial Decree is easier to farm, has comparable stats, and while not getting adept mods, is able to stay stat for stat compared to Astral Horizon (Adept). Taking a look at both shotguns with Barrel Shroud, Accurized, Threat Detector, Opening Shot, and a Range masterwork / frame. Even with an adept Range mod on Atral Horizon both shotguns have the same range stat of 79, handling is actually best on Imperial Decree by 2 (43 to 41).

Rewind Rounds or Demolitionist both work as support perks in the first trait column, pairing Hatchling for Strand synergy (which should be even better when the additional fragments arrive). The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius (let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion), or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel. If you do catch a chunkier enemy, Spike Grenades is nice for a little extra impact damage, and then the unique combination of Chain Reaction as your first trait column support perk - let's face it, it's unusual to have it as a support perk - and Hatchling as the signature perk in the second trait column. Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content.

Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much).

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads.

(??? ???): First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag.

Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with.

In the first trait column as your support perk, Envious Assassin overflows the magazine or the most quick shots to finish off a major or stunned Champion quickly, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot. This combination should make you a bit of a walking tank in add-dense areas, as long as you have ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats (so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time). Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The first Strand flavoured LMG as at v7.0.0.3 but unfortunately stats are low by comparison with other adaptive frames - but there's still a choice of very usable rolls. Chambered Compensator takes the recoil direction to a controllable 90 and adds some extra stability. If you're using this for add clear, any one of the combat effect rounds (High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing or Ricochet Rounds) will work in the mag, then a reload park like Feeding Frenzy, maybe Keep Away if you're not up to your neck in CQC adds, Pulse Monitor to refill the magazine when your shield's broken, or Envious Assassin to overfill the magazine before you start, should work nicely. In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major.

Reconstruction then doubles your mag size, and bypasses any reload penalty and means that the top 3/4 of your magazine will now proc Chill Clip.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and end-game content. The first kinetic slot high-impact fusion rifle - it needs handling and stability to improve gunfeel, but it might be worth hanging onto in case the archetype gets a little love. Fusion Rifle range is very constrained, so look for handling with your barrel, and Ionized or Enhanced Battery adds extra shots. If you spray with your first shot, then the SOFA (Stats/One For All) roll will more than offset any reload penalty, along with other gunfeel boosts, as well as increasing damage by a chunky 35%. The Omolon origin trait is useful in the top half of the mag, to help with reloads and a touch of extra stability too.

I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "I don’t know how to feel about Wilderflight in PvP. Technically you can do more damage with double impact, and have some forgiveness with proximity grenades. But it also means that the architecture can really mess you up if you go to bounce shot and it splits the grenades into two different directions. I have yet to fully test out the full damage of each grenade, but disruption break will still probably be then play. Being able to hit one grenade and break a shield will give your kinetic 50% more damage which will definitely drop any guardian with ease." Recommended MW - Blast Radius.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds.

[...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control.

If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW.

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue.

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

To pair with Voltshot, forget Feeding Frenzy as it doesn't pair well so, instead, Threat Detector  will speed up your reloads and boost your stability while you're in CQC or Perpetual Motion will do the same just for moving about a bit.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for Stasis subclass synergy. No second origin trait, but Dawning Surprise helps you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so - ideal in keeping you alive in CQC. In the blade slot, Jagged Edge to maximises damage or Tempered Edge balances a bit of extra damage and ammo, for all-round utility.

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em.

With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist.

Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / Controller): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,controller

The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Dreadful stats compared to any other energy rapid-fire pulse rifle as at v6.2.5.1, but it's the only solar one currently available. Wonky recoil direction of 50, so you'll need to straighten that out as much as possible with a Recoil Direction barrel, Stability Barrel or a bit of both. Take your choice of the combat-effect mag perks in your mag slot. Subsistence keeps your mag topped up and Frenzy provides a decent 15% damage boost in combat.

The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b).

Swords aren't necessarily a top choice for PvP, as at v6.2.5, but this does come with a very useful perk in Eager Edge to close the gap unexpectedly on an opponent. Jagged Edge adds damage, and Swordmaster's Guard gets your power attack as quickly as possible. Eager Edge is your must have in the first trait column and Vorpal Weapon is the best of a very PvE orientated set of traits in the second.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag). For melee builds, Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the natural choice - get a melee kill for a refreshable 33% damage boost, and then each hit regenerates a little melee energy from the origin trait, while each kill regenerates a full 10%.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod). If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage.

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s (12s with the Enhanced Perk) for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Sidearms aren't first choice for end-game activities but, if you're forced to use one there because of an anti-Champion mod, the you do have some options here. Range is highly constrained (maximising it only gets you another 0.7m when ADS), so you'll get more value out of Handling or Stability from your barrel, and any of the combat effect mods (Armor-Piercing, High Caliber or Riochet Rounds) will work. If you need an Osmosis sidearm (you only really need one in your Vault, so check first) then, as you'll be in CQC range, use Threat Detector to pair with Osmosis to give you another option for weapon energy type, which can be useful in solo endgame content.

//notes:PvE first-choice roll for general content. Good overall stats, but has 1 less point of Zoom than its competitors, so you might need to add a little extra range to make up for that with the barrel and mag choices - Extended Barrel does this and take the Recoil Direction to a maximum 100. Ricochet Rounds then pushes Range out by a total of about 1.25m, and smooths things with a dab of Stability too.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane).

// Mindbender's Ambition
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Handling “In PvP you can make arguments for and against the return of Mindbender's Ambition. On one hand it is still a strong aggressive frame shotgun that can get adept mods. On the other hand so is the Timelost Found Verdict and VoG is less of a challenge. Master VoG will still kick an unprepared ass, but will not be nearly as difficult as it used to be. To make Mindbender's Ambition work in the crucible you will have to invest into range and handling.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

// Qullim's Terminus (Harrowed)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I get why Bungie had to change Qullim's Terminus from a 450 to a 360, that would make 3 raids that have 450 machine guns. But Bungie also knows that you cannot craft a Commemoration or Corrective Measure. So I feel like it should have been a 450. Nevertheless it is here as a 360 and we have to like it. Arrowhead will max out the recoil direction, and firing line will give you that big damage. I do not feel comfortable recommending use of a 360 in a raid or dungeon for maximum damage, but in a strike I could see it being a solid option.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Machine Gun Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// The Inquisitor (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Handling “In PvP the Inquisitor falls into a very subpar place. With aerial effectiveness being the way that it is, you really cannot make the same plays as you used to. Even with max AE for your build and opening shot it is still a gamble to even connect, let alone get a crit kill. Keep your boots on the ground and if you want a slug shotgun without sacrificing your exotic slot, I would consider this one.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Shotgun Special Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP Controller): Recommended MW: Stability “PvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I do not see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, Controller

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.

Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

Go for range with your barrel and mag.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

// Tears of Contrition
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Precision frame scouts do not have a strong presence in PvP. To give you the best chance using one, use arrowhead brake. That will clean up the recoil enough. There aren’t many lanes that require 80m+ of range, so going for steady rounds will make each shot easier to land. No distractions also combats a lot of the flinch scouts naturally take. Explosive payload increases your outgoing flinch. All of these steps should give you the best chance in the Crucible." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "PvP is where this weapon will sing. Kill clip and feeding frenzy are still both great for Crucible purposes. I know a decent number of players will go for iron reach to hit that coveted 20-21m effective range. Neither are bad options but I would rate ricochet rounds higher over high-caliber rounds when using iron reach for that touch of stability. On the other hand high-caliber rounds will help you win those 1v1 situations to proc kill clip." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// The Wizened Rebuke
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I absolutely loved using my firmly planted and tap the trigger Wizened Rebuke back in the Forsaken era of Seasons 6 and 7. With the fusion changes I would highly recommend cleaning up the recoil direction to make sure that you have the easiest time controlling the burst. For PvE similar to Riptide you will want vorpal weapon for the best success. Subsistence helps keep the voops going." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Wizened Rebuke
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "For PvP you’ll also want to increase the recoil direction while also increasing the stability. The two most important factors for deep OHK on a fusion are zoom followed by stability. Because the Wizened Rebuke cannot roll rangefinder, the next best thing is to invest into stability to make sure that all the bolts hit. Under pressure also ensures that the little ammo you do get has the best benefits for each shot. Successful warm-up is one of my favorite perks for fusions to really make that second kill super easy to secure." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "Where I’ve heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura’s Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid. Keep an eye out for this one." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,controller

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lunulata-4b is a great alternative in the kinetic slot. The clear choice is to pair it with any of the stasis builds, and you’d be absolutely correct. Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option.

// A Sudden Death (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Stiff competition in the slot from Found Verdict, and suffers by comparison from having no adept version. For clearing heftier minors or groups of majors, choose a barrel that helps with handling or stability, then Assault Mag increases firing rate, or Tactical Mag/ Appended Mag increases mag size to maximum. Then Threat Detector, Grave Robber, Field Prep or Slideshot help to keep you shooting, and Frenzy provides a solid damage boost when in combat. Worth pairing with the Heavy Handed Charged With Light Mod for free ammo regeneration on CQC kills. Drops from the final (Emissary) chest if you're looking to farm it.

[...] Much like the rest of this season, you want to craft one with arrowhead brake to get that recoil direction up. Slotting just a counterbalance mod would suffice but you lose out on all the spec mods or backup mag. I think harmony or adrenaline junkie are going to be your best perks for general utility and major killing. But chill clip in conjunction with stasis builds will be really strong together.".

Syncopation doesn’t have anything to push it into the 2 burst realm outside of person buffs (empowering rift, inertia override, etc) but it does have utter consistency. Arrowhead cleans up the recoil perfectly, while high-caliber rounds makes it harder to get hit in return. Then the choice between moving target, the newly buffed hip-fire grip in combination with headseeker or rangefinder." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,controller

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind. You could definitely opt for some of the other perks here too as nothing really screams PvE."|tags:pve,controller

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / Controller): "For PvP I really value Rangefinder. It would give it the competitive edge over guns like Thorn or Ace and increase Hawkmoon’s already stellar consistency. If you don’t like the increased Zoom then something like Snapshot Sights really makes Hawkmoon feel snappy. You also can’t go wrong with Eye of the Storm, Opening Shot, or Killing Wind."|tags:pvp,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."

// Last Perdition (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good controller) - "[...] Last Perdition is basically Bygones but Void, with sights instead of barrels! [...] slightly better stability, and slightly worse range and recoil direction."

// False Promises
//notes: (PvP / Controller): Mercules904 (pretty good PvP/controller) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pvp,controller
