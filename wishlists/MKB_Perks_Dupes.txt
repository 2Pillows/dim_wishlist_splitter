@description:Second six Season 23 BRAVE arsenal weapons with the Indomitability origin trait

// Midnight Coup (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds), Explosive Payload, (Kinetic Tremors, One for All, Frenzy, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors (which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors), One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments.

// The Mountaintop (PvE first-choice roll)
// Hard Launch, (Implosion Rounds, Spike Grenades), Auto-Loading Holster, (Recombination, Frenzy, Vorpal Weapon)

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. You're looking for Hard Launch ideally, but any barrel that boosts handling still works, to speed up swap speed. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Overflow puts two in the mag just for running over an ammo brick, or Ambitious Assassin does the same after a kill. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon provide a reliable +15%, with Frenzy also boosting your reload speed and handling.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod), and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod), and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling and then, unusually, Sticky Grenades is the top mag perk for this particularl roll (bear with us). Either Field Prep or Cascade Point and Deconstruct together make this a great DPS choice. Either just take advantage of two extra reserve ammo and faster reload and handling from Field Prep, or proc Cascade Point with a couple of sniper crits and to proc the higher fire rate, while Deconstruct with Sticky Grenades pulls bonus ammo out of the air on every second, rather than every third, hit because of the delay before the explosive damage. This extends your effective magazine size to 11, but only using 6 ammo.

Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. While Eager Edge was the unique Dares perk back in the day, it's appeared elsewhere since so Relentless Strikes is probably the more sensible first column trait perk to combine with Surrounded in the second for 35% (41.8% when enhanced) bonus damage when in a crowd.

For add clearing, the trait perk combination, that's unique to The Slammer, of Chain Reaction and Cold Steel spreads slow stacks (which you can improve with Stasis subclass fragments) with the add kill explosions and, when enhanced, Cold Steel also adds a useful 10 to the inventory stat for additional ammo reserves. You'll probably find more use for the Vanguard's Vindication origin trait, unless there's a champion mod around for swords that works with Stunning Recovery.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Hitting 3 targets in PvE is certainly easier than hitting multiple targets in PvP. If you can make Stats for All work in PvP I will be impressed. A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column. Wellspring could pair well with Demolitionist for even more ability energy, or Desperate Measures for a damage bonus without needing a weapon kill to start."

// The Mountaintop
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "We can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Mountaintop
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Mountaintop originally didn't have much of a footing in PvP but quickly dove right into our nightmares. If you want a quick-swap roll go for Slickdraw. If you want more of a long ranged tube shotgun roll, Impulse Amplifier will make the grenade shot near instant. With the way special ammo is shaking up in the crucible through the meter or boxes, I think some of the best perks for Mountaintop are the swap perks, Harmony and Recombination. Both allow you to build up a higher damage shot to make Mountaintop one shot again, bringing it back to Recluse or another Harmony weapon to flex on all the hunters out there."

Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "The extra health added with the 7.3.5 update made a big switch to heavy grenade launcher perks. Now you'll need to invest heavier into Blast Radius to hit around 65+ in order to reliably OHK a guardian of all resilience levels. Volatile Launch with a Blast Radius MW gets us to 75, High-Explosive Ordinance brings that up to 85 and evens out the hit to velocity from Volatile Launch. Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier. With the perk shake up I'd personally take Explosive Light in the fourth column to bring the blast radius up to 100 and get some extra explosion damage but Destabilizing Rounds is also good if you're looking for a pseudo-Chain Reaction."

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well.

Arrowhead Brake is the best in slot for making the recoil direction vertical, but if you don't need that, Corkscrew Rifling or Fluted Barrel for the added stats. Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched.

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Forbearance (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Hitting 3 targets in PvE is certainly easier than hitting multiple targets in PvP. If you can make Stats for All work in PvP I will be impressed. A better perk would be Demolitionist for a total of 15% ability energy back on kills (10% paired with 5% from the origin trait), or Disruption Break to give your kinetic weapons a nice 50% damage boost. There isn't a lot to be said in column 4 for PvP as most Disruption Break grenade launchers are paired with Auto-Loading Holster in the third column. Wellspring could pair well with Demolitionist for even more ability energy, or Desperate Measures for a damage bonus without needing a weapon kill to start."

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills.

With the way special ammo is shaking up in the crucible through the meter or boxes, I think some of the best perks for Mountaintop are the swap perks, Harmony and Recombination.

Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots.

Paired up with Impulse Amplifier and you'll hardly notice a difference compared to a max velocity roll without Impulse Amplifier.

Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities.

Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch.

Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well.

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Especially now that Explosive Payload has been brought back up to not have a resilience check. Moving Target will bring Midnight Coup to a nice even 100 aim assist, the only other gun to achieve this is Eyasluna with Moving Target, any sight, and a targeting adjustor. Pair this with Zen Moment or Opening Shot and you'll have an incredibly strong dueling weapon. Zen Moment makes subsequent shots easier by increasing your flinch resistance, and Opening Shot starting the duel out on the best possible foot. Midnight Coup suffers from below average range, so I would recommend Hammer-Forged Rifling to bring that up, with Zen Moment you won't need to worry about stability as much, but I would stay away from dropping any stats with Full Bore."

// Multimach CCX
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Multimach is back and boy do I have conflicting views on this. Should we invest in lethality or consistency? Iron Reach will be incredible in 3v3 game modes, as well as Trials and potentially in Rumble, but Kill Clip will be even better for 6v6 game modes or slayers. Ideally you’ll find a healthy mix of range and stability, but Dynamic Sway Reduction will cover most of your stability if you opt for Iron Reach. If you prefer Kill Clip, then I would recommend Moving Target for better movement speed and being that quick slayer we all know you are." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:mkb,pvp

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You don't need to run a strand subclass but if you do then Slice and Hatchling can sever enemies to reduce their damage output (very useful in a boss fight to help your fireteam), and generate Threadlings for additional damage to synergise with your fragments.

//notes:SirStallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Scouts are weird. Lets just start there. I like the idea of scouts, but in practice.. Theyre just strange. BUT, they do one thing quite well.. Precision kills. So, between Enlightened Action keeping your reload up and making the gun feel snappy, and then Hatchling helping you dispatch groups of enemies at the same time, I think this roll has a lot of low end potential for fun. Which lets be honest.. Isn't that what we all want?" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

The rest of the roll is all about making your weapon a stat monster for 1v1s. I like 720s for 3v3 gamemodes, I think they're fun as heck. So giving my weapon a stat package that would make Banshee blush is always my goal.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Still the only Lightweight Strand scout rifle with pretty solid stats. For min-maxxers, the +20 Mobility from the intrinsic perk and +6.25% movement speed can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to control the recoil, as well as flesh out the stats with the barrel perk. For the magazine perk, you're looking to reduce reload speed, or boost magazine size (or a bit of everything with Tactical Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk passively boosts PvE damage. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag.

You can find the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds on a few different weapons - you could argue that it's better on auto-rifles like Ros Arago or Age-Old Bond - but the combination of an overshield and volatile enemies in CQC is definitely a fun one, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Gyrfalcon Hunters. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. Gyrfalcon void Hunters can already apply volatile rounds at will so kills to proc Repulsor Brace in the first trait column will be easy - but be aware this overrides the Void reserve Shield so you don't get the boost to class ability regeneration - but you do get the origin trait boost instead. In CQC you'll probably find the Overshield damage reduction really useful anyway, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence. With the second column, as you don't need Destabilizing Rounds, Surrounded is a great passive boost to damage - up to 47% when you're able to enhance the perk. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful in the play loop to get your dodge back faster - Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for velocity, handling and reload speed. Field Prep in the first trait column makes up somewhat for the inventory stat, and when it's enhanced it's only one shot away from max ammo, without the need for any reserve mods (one would get you to the max). Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns in end-game activities.

There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

In the first trait column, this is the only current (as at v7.3.0.6) auto rifle with Permeability, which is a great pairing for Golden Tricorn in the second column, so you can match damage to any subclass to proc the second damage stack.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. Parabellum has decent stats and a nice clean sight picture. Round out the range, stability and recoil direction stats to your preference with the barrel perk. You're looking for a snappy reload, so Alloy Mag is the best mag perk choice, but the stability from Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell make Parabellum easier to control. Heal Clip in the first trait column and Frenzy in the second work well - Frenzy boosts reload speed (and handling) to 100 anyway as well as adding a +15% damage boost. The fast reload, means it's easier to proc Cure from Heal Clip, which you can use with Ember of Benevolence on a solar subclass. The Field-Tested origin trait is a slow burn but, if you can stay alive, the stacks do build up to have a pretty significant impact on the gunfeel stats.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. Combine Slice, in the first trait column, to reduce damage output by 40% from bulkier adds with Hatchling for additional crowd control, and throw in supportive fragments to augment both, and this could be a fun add-suppressing and add-clearing roll.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. With one eye on Bipod as the second column trait, as there's no Field Prep option, you'll start off with 2 in the mag and 12 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to five in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 4 in the tube at the rate of one every 4s, or Clown Cartridge provides 3 or 4 after a manual reload. For burst and sustained Boss damage, Bipod just about breaks even with 25% less damage and slower reloads, but faster firing and more reserve ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Uzume RR4 has very nice stats in it's subfamily, but the 50 zoom is either a blessing or a curse, depending on your viewpoint. Either way this is only worth keeping if you don't have a decent solar sniper, or it's better than the one you're replacing. The recoil direction of 75 is vertical, but if you're firing repeatedly at a crit spot it's still a good idea to control it with a boost to recoil direction or additional stability from your barrel perk. Handling is always nice to have too. Appended Mag gets you an extra shot - you can also use Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell to boost reload speed as your mag perk instead. In the first trait column as the support park, Fourth Time's The Charm or Clown Cartridge are pretty much tied - if you can reliably hit crits, FttC might get you an extra shot more reliably before reloading. In the second as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon is the best of the bunch for a permanently-on +15% against Major Spec and Boss Spec enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies, or Boss spec enemies with short damage windows in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives. For this roll, you'll be looking to block damage, so a Guard perk like Burst Guard or Balanced Guard works best. This is the only sword dropping in S23 with the combination of Flash Counter and Counterattack - get in close to a tanky enemy to bait them into a melee/slam attack, and then the combination of weaken and bonus damage provides +80% damage for 2s, and +20% for the next two, which should be enough time to put a serious dent in their health bar. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun.

Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. This shouldn't be your chase weapon but, if you need a waepon for boss damage, then Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives, and Swordmaster's Guard provides a little bit of everything as the guard perk. For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%.

Swordmaster's Guard provides an all-round boost to stats in the guard slot. For your support perk in the first trait slot, you could boost ammo reserves with Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes, or regenerate health with Unrelenting. For your signature perk in the second trait slot. Surrounded or One For All both boost damage, in case you come up against something a bit bulkier.

Swordmaster's Guard provides an all-round boost to stats in the guard slot. For your support perk in the first trait slot, Repulsor Brace will provide a very handy void overshield when procced, while in the second, you can either take advantage of void abilities and use Surrounded in CQC or Destabilizing Rounds to apply a cloud of volatility.

First-choice PvE pick for damage against vehicles and constructs in end-game content. Belisarius-D (Belisarius isn't a dinosaur, but rather a 5th Century Byzantine general) has strong stats but, like all Aggressive Burst pulse rifles, suffers poor handling and reload speed. Arrowhead Brake adds handling and corrects the recoil direction to 100 or Fluted Barrel gives the highest handling bump as the barrel perk. Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. For a unique roll - something to add to a collection, just in case you ever need it - Vorpal Weapon is in the first trait column(!), so if you pair it with Deconstruct in the second and Hakke Breach Armaments as the origin trait, with a Boss Spec mod, and that's every perk available that provides additional damage against vehicles and constructs.

Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. The traits are mostly PvP flavoured but Slice and Hatchling in the first and second trait columns work together as a weapon to synergise with Strand subclass fragments - this could make it a good option as part of a Bait and Switch rotation with Slice reducing outgong damage from a major boss by 40% when procced - or alternatively, Rapid Hit and Keep Away, again in the first column bump up gunfeel stats.

For Strand synergy, Slice and Hatchling in the two trait columns give you the two perks to work with using your aspects and fragments. Slice also makes this a good swap weapon in a Bait and Switch rotation, applying 40% reduction in damage output from affected targets when procced after using your class ability.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts.

The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. Retold Tale has okay stats compared to other precision frame shotguns and the trait pool is weighted towards PvP, but there's still some nice combinations here. First, for the barrel perk, Barrel Shroud, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful stats and for the mag slot while Assault Mag or Tactical Mag are the top two choices, Light Mag or Appended Mag aren't bad alternatives.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases damage and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC with a boss. The usual trait combination of Relentless Strikes, returning one ammo for everyth three light hits, and Whirlwind Blade for an escalating +3% bump to damage topping off at +30% for landing light hits makes for a decent, if not top-tier option for boss DPS phases. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +20 charge rate for faster heavy attacks, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you don't, then maybe consider trying to craft a Caretaker from Dares of Eternity before settling. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases ammo and reserves (adds will die to a single hit anyway) and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC. The usual trait combination of Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes to extend your ammo and Incandescent to help with add clear, should make room clearing easy. You don't need to use a solar subclass but you can improve scorch and ignite verbs further with your fragments.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. Like other High-Impact Rocket Launchers with their high blast radius, Sleepless really only has one role, and that's add clearing - maybe for Gunsmith bounties. If you're going that way, you could maximise the Blast Radius with Volatile Launch as the barrel perk, and then boost Velocity with High-Velocity Rounds or reload Speed with Alloy Casing in the mag. You might as well have as many rockets to shoots as you can, so Field Prep boosts your reserves by one and reload speed further, as the first trait perk to support Chain Reaction in the second to really make sure that everything in the blast radius is dead.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. Like other High-Impact Rocket Launchers with their high blast radius, Sleepless really only has one role, and that's add clearing - maybe for Gunsmith bounties. You might be better off waiting until you can craft a Semiotician with enchanced versions of the traits, but if you can't wait, you could boost Blast Radius and Velocity with Linear Compensator as the barrel perk, and then boost Blast Radius with Black Powder in the mag. You might as well have as many rockets to shoots as you can, so Field Prep boosts your reserves by one and reload speed further, as the first trait perk to support Chain Reaction in the second to really make sure that everything in the blast radius is dead. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

// Tigerspite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Tigerspite is one of those guns that despite not having the best perks, the best stats, or even the best model; something about it feels phenomenal. I enjoy almost every Tigerspite I use, and I am excited to get more of them. Kinetic Tremors, Frenzy, or Kill Clip will depend on your activity and favorite damage boost. Pair it with your favorite reload or reload bypassing perk and you’ve got a dependable workhorse auto that just feels like bliss." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Tigerspite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Tigerspite now has a better glow-up for PvP. Fragile Focus is great for starting an engagement but will quickly lose its value the longer you’re in a gunfight. Moving Target is neutrally good for providing a better strafe speed and some much needed aim assist. I prefer Kill Clip in the final column to lower my TtK requirements in subsequent kills, but if you’re going to take this into Trials or 3v3 game modes, Eye of the Storm might be better for its consistency duel to duel."

// Retold Tale
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Retold Tale is not a PvE shotgun. It does come with some nice PvE perks like One-Two Punch, but the lack of Grave Robber lowers it in my opinion. Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace have good synergy but on a shotgun I’d rather take a good damage perk over an add clearing one." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retold Tale
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Retold Tale was and still is one of my favorite shotguns. I used it a ton before getting my best Mindbender’s Ambition. I still prefer the U shaped sights on Retold. I grinded out a decent Compass Rose with QuickDraw and Snapshot Sights, so we will see if Retold will be better. I think most players will still opt for a Matador but having a super snappy shotgun won’t hurt your vault space too much (though seeing the state of your vault it might be a tough squeeze /s)." Recommended MW: Handling or Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Twilight Oath
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Similarly to Retold Tale, Twilight Oath has PvE perks but not the best position. Envious Assassin is great for overfilling the magazine, and Vorpal Weapon will net you great damage. You can utilize the full extent of Precision Instrument, my biggest issue is the frame. Rapid-fire frame snipers are hard to utilize at max RPM and require a hard pull down to keep on target. With the crit box shrinking on some bosses and champions doing what champions want to do, it will be hard to continuously hit crits at max RPM. Otherwise it’s a pretty solid general use sniper."

I never used a Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot roll, but I think it would be fun.

And while Night Watch has still kept some of its relevance over the years, Doom of Chelchis has overtaken Vouchsafe for the best in slot weapon. Vouchsafe does retain some great perks in Rapid Hit and Explosive Payload, while also adding in great perks like Repulsor Brace and Golden Tricorn.

Golden Tricorn 2x does allow you to 3 shot any guardian at any resilience at a 0.60 TtK, but it requires two whole kills to get rolling and without additional ability kills you’ll be back at square one before you know it.

// Waking Vigil
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Let’s talk about power creep. When Waking Vigil released it was a phenomenal arc hand cannon. Outclassed by Nation of Beasts for the best arc hand cannon. With its midlife refresh Waking Vigil was blessed with a reload perk and an AoE perk through Dragonfly. However it was still overshadowed by Nation of Beasts and by then Ancient Gospel. When the hand cannon merger happened, Waking Vigil lost its only claim to fame being a Lightweight hand cannon versus the aforementioned adaptives.

It was great when rockets could be used everywhere and when we didn’t have to reload via Lunafaction Boots or Rally Barricades. Currently you’ll find very limited uses out of most rockets. There are a few options that have risen to the top, but it means most rockets are going to fall into general utility tools. Sleepless has Chain Reaction for better add clear, and Auto-Loading Holster for quality of life.

With a blast radius masterwork you’ll sit at 100 even, that way you can invest your other perks into velocity and handling, bringing up some of its lower stats. With Quick Launch and High-Velocity Rounds you’re looking at a nice 60 velocity. It won’t beat Impulse Amplifier for the quickest rocket but it will move.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Being a stasis trace rifle already gives Appetence viability in a lot of loadouts. No longer are you tied to Ager’s Scepter for a “kinetic” trace rifle. Appetence is also legendary so you open up a plethora of loadout possibilities. In PvE you can make the most of this trace rifle with Overflow and Killing Tally for a 21% Delirium-lite. Being able to walk over bricks of special to double the magazine capacity keeps Killing Tally primed and ready to rip into any wave of enemy you might have in front of you. If you prefer a more calculated approach or don’t want to use just one weapon, Headstone is extremely strong with the buffed Stasis subclasses." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Already having low ammo, and the current economy of ammo bricks will severely limit your overall usage. If you can horde ammo bricks like Scrooge you can certainly make this weapon work better. Enlightened Action will make the weapon feel better, and Headstone can deny revives or build into the Stasis subclass like in PvE.

Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively.

But for a “Kinetic” fusion rifle I think Scatter Signal rivals and possibly beats out Riptide for best in slot fusion. Overflow and Controlled Burst for added damage throughout the magazine. You’ll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Slug shotguns are not nearly as dominant as they used to be. They used to be a high skill, high reward weapon that prioritized good aim for in return a deep OHK. Threat Detector and Fragile Focus both boost your already good range and handling.

Either pulse is only better than the other by less than 3 points in each category, except for airborne effectiveness and recoil direction, 9 and 10 respectively.

Successful Warm-Up gives you a better draw time post-defeat, but has a bit less utility against higher health enemies. Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame hand cannons have not had their time in the spotlight for a while. Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer’s Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon.

Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range."

When Rampage and Outlaw were all we cared about. Things have shifted and more weapons are certainly popular. The only true competition Subjunctive needs to worry about is the Ikelos SMG. Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It’s not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec’ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets.

The one thing that separated it from Wastelander was the lack of Opening Shot, this version comes with Opening Shot, and Slideshot for the coveted 100 range. With all the investments into range your barrel and masterwork should be geared towards handling." Recommended MW: Range or Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Bait and Switch is interesting for keeping up damage but not having a reliable magazine overflow perk hurts a bit more. Ambitious Assassin is great, but Envious is better.

It’s less useful without Match Game but it can still be useful for taking out shields faster. Archer’s Tempo is fantastic on bows for lowering successive draw times, and Precision Instrument fits nicely as you’ll want to hit those crits, the draw time allowing you a bit of forgiveness lining up those crit shots.

Impulse Amplifier can turn this into a near instant pseudo-grenade launcher shot, but I think most players are going to opt for Beacon Rounds for better tracking and hip-fire usage. The tracking isn’t incredible side to side, for when a Dawnblade flies across your screen, but for general strafing the tracking at low levels is great. At higher buffs you can start to get into a groove and be a bit more loose with your aim, but I wouldn’t rely heavily on the tracking. Adagio makes Indebted Kindness a reliable two shot, which I think feeds well into Beacon Rounds." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Cold Front (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this and then the SOFA (Stats/ One For All) combination of trait perks to round out the stats further and add a chunky 35% bonus damage. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10sand grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up (if a bit loose) at 55, and if you're comfortable with this - p[articularly with M+KB, you could look to boost the range with your barrel perk. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you've not already got a Stasis pulse rifle with Desperado, this can provide you with an option - if you have, then you can pass. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of bulkier Minor, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can bypass that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one. In the first trait column, Grave Robber procs on glaive melees, or Field prep boosts reserves, and reload speed when crouched, and Close to Melee in the second boosts melee damage by 30% for a projectile hit. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and Champions in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. But it has a trick that now other sword can do - the Cold Steel trait perk. For single target damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. As your trait perk combination, both Relentless Strikes and Cold Steel proc off three hits, with the first two Cold Steel hits Stasis slowing and the third hit freezing enemies. That covers Overload and Unstoppable Champions. Throw on Radiant from a solar subclass to cover Barriers too, and you have the sword equivalent of Riptide which will freeze lock Majors with every third hit, and which you can apply Stasis subclass fragments too as well.

First-choice PvE pick for support against Major and Boss spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Precision Instrument in the second could make for an interesting combination to apply Sever to majors and bosses from range - even when they're immune to damage - to reduce their damage output by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity (effectively a 40% DR for the whole fireteam) as well as doing decent, for a primary weapon, damage with the boost from Precision Instrument.

The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Collective Action in the second makes this a bit of a Swiss-army knife of weapons. Slice, with Strand of Continuity, Severs an enemy to reduce their damage output by 40% for 15s - you can use this effect on Majors and Bosses, even during an immunity phase to grant an effective 40% damage reduction for your whole fireteam. Or, apply Sever to a minor and kill it to spawn a Tangle that you can use with Collective Action for a 20% damage boost for 7s, then rinse and repeat.

This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Archer's Tempo or Explosive Head in the first train column and Successful Warm-Up in the second will increase damage output either directly or through increased rate-of-fire. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Naeem's Lance (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for against Major or Boss Spec enemies, particularly with Strand subcalsses, in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception, having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice, taking the stat to a manageable 84. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag (seven) as Appended and Extended Mag, but either of those work too. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively, while Slice in the second trait makes this possibly the best special weapon to pair with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon - reducing the Severed target's damage output by 40% for 10s (15s with Thread of Continuity if you're using a Strand subclass) - an effective additional 40% DR for your whole fireteam. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't.

The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second.

// Zephyr
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cold Steel is Zephyr's claim to fame. Zephyr is the only sword with Cold Steel and you'll want to stack as many charge time benefits as possible. Duelist's Trance grants +60 to charge rate and both Guard Resistance and Endurance. This all allows you to heavy swing more frequently. Stacking the extra slow debuff faster. Tempered Edge also gives you more ammo while adding more impact as well. Dealing better damage is always good." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Panda (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Zephyr was one of my favorite swords when it was introduced in season 2. I still think it looks incredible. In PvP you'll want some good guard resistance so you can get close and if you happen to have multiple enemies stacked up you can get Chain Reaction kills. More booms equals better, no?"

// Zephyr
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I won't lie, I straight lifted this roll from last years post because I never got it and I still think it could be interesting for a stasis build. Wellspring to keep your abilities up, which will in turn provide slow/freeze in combination with Cold Steel to leave targets more vulnerable to more attacks. There is potential for a fun cycle there, and it utilises Cold Steel which is what makes this sword particularly unique." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Stallion (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Unfortunately, Zephyr would not be my first pick for PvP swords. Its not craftable, Cold Steel is pointless and its not an interesting frame. BUT. This would be what I'd take into PvP if I had to. Duelist benefits the player after a kill until you put the sword away, but since heavy is not very frequent in PvP, you're likely gonna commit to using all your ammo up. So Duelist gives the best benefit in slot imo. Vorpal is a nice safety net incase your heavy spawn gets assaulted by a super (I've seen it happen, it's terrifying), you might be able to fight back a little easier."

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don't know how often this glaive will be used over the crafted gloves but there's a nice niche between Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee. If you get any glaive kill you'll activate Beacon Rounds, with the added tracking you can shoot off in the general direction of a thrall and with that kill you'll activate Close to Melee to deal an extra 30% more melee damage. Any additional damage with your melee or projectile you'll keep up Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee to continue the chaining of better tracking and better damage." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Panda (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "With Auxiliary Reserves you get some great shield duration. With Light Mag and Keep Away you negate the reload speed loss from Auxiliary Reserves. All the range gives you a velocity of 130 m/s which is 1.11x times faster than the base 117 m/s. This extra speed will make the hit registration feel better. If you can manage to get Golden Tricorn 2x with one surge mod you can one hit kill any guardian 6 resilience or below. As you add one surge mod you can down an additional resilience tier. It scales 1:1." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Okay here's my thought process.. This weapon needs to be really unique to justify using over a crafted Glaive. What makes it unique is Beacon Rounds. Beacon Rounds are an ease of use perk, they're built to make you miss less shots without slowing down combat by aiming (gross, all my homies hate aiming). So my plan is to make myself a one man phalanx, storming forward with homing shots that aim themselves. Demolitionist to help me panic reload, plus just keeping my grenade energy up, and more shield duration to aid in the goal of becoming phalanx. Also, Honourable mention to Golden Tricorn potentially being very fun to mess around with." Recommended MW: Shield Duration.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

But here's what I'm thinking: Max Range for max projectile speed, bonus handling to make it less hefty to switch to, Beacon Rounds because auto-aim potentially gooder, demo simply because there's nothing else I feel is worth using in that slot. High Impact Reserves is only a 6% damage boost, Golden Tricorn might be tricky to keep active in PvP, Lead From Gold serves no purpose in PvP.. It's just tricky.

The difference between minimum range and maximum range is like 3.5m, and while that might be significant if this weapon is your primary, it is not significant in my use case. A secondary. A sidearm, with a substantial heft boost. As much handling as I can squeeze out without losing a usable amount of stability, then Perpetual Motion to help those stats even further.

In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist.

(First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Mechabre (it's so obviously a pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. One thing you could do is use it to apply jolt to beefier targets at a distance. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk. Building towards the end, Flared Magwell gives the biggest boost to reload speed out of the magazine perks, with Tactical Mag a decent alternative. Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85. Get one kill against an add, reload and then Voltshot in the second column as the signature perk can apply jolt to your next target from a safe distance for burst and AoE damage. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

If you weren't around to shape your own Regnant, and don't have a decently-rolled Explosive Light grenade launcher, Acosmic (named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense, according to Merriam-Webster) is a void rapid-fire frame GL, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty, and is a viable option. Use the barrel perk to get shots to the target as fast as possible, and Spike Grenades adds 13.3% to total damage for a direct hit in the magazine slot. In the first column, for the support trait perk, saves a reserves perk on your chest and significantly boosts reload when you crouch. Explosive Light is the second column as the signature perk adds +52.5% to total damage for up to six shots for great burst damage, as well as boosting the blast radius to 100 - great against Majors surrounded by minor adds.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 83 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ISDC0TSrLmfEyPuI9oU2m?si=9fbd5a7cf0bc4f07) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add-clearing in end-game content. Grenade launchers may not be anyone's first choice for add clearing, but Acosmic (named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense, according to Merriam-Webster) is a void rapid-fire frame GL, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty, and is a viable option.. Get your blast radius as high as possible with your barrel and mag perks, so you can catch as many adds as possible with your shots. In the first trait column as the support perk, new to season 22 Loose Change boosts reload speed by 50 when you apply an elemental debuff, which is just what Destabilizing Rounds in the second column as the signature perk does. You should be able to clear crowded rooms fast and soften up beefier enemies. The Nadir Focus origin trait boosts your shot velocity further, which is a nice little bonus.

title: RNGeez Festival of the Lost Breakdown, Season 22
description: FotL S22 picks from u/SirStallion_, u/PandaPaxxy, and u/Clegmir

// Horror Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "So Horror Story is stasis now. Kinda cool, but not the biggest draw. The combo I'm looking for is Enlightened Action and Target Lock. The two of them together give you bonus handling, reload, and damage. As long as you're connecting shots you'll get the benefits of both!" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=365154968,3828510309

// Horror Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP you could swap out Enlightened Action for Dynamic Sway Reduction or maybe even Demolitionist. But I'd say that the handling bonus will feel really nice. A base of 37 handling isn't ideal, so the slight bonus from Arrowhead Brake coupled with Enlightened Action will make this auto rifle feel more like an SMG." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=365154968,3828510309

// Horror Story
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This gun will be special. Not meta shifting or game breaking, but special. For me, there's an undeniable good feel when it comes to 450s, I love using them but finding a way to best make use of them typically comes down to how I can nuke the most trash mobs in the fastest time. In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass. Other weapons with this combo have existed, and they're multiclass. A self contained stasis machine. I will be hunting for this, for sure." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=124408337,3523296417

// Horror Story
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "As a primarily controller player, I believe 450s are some of the easiest guns to control. Stability is not as necessary, but preference is a thing and you should absolutely commit to whichever stat you feel is best. But the trait combo remains the same for my ideal. I will never just be using one gun, chances are if I get special ammo I'm going to be trying to use that special ammo and discord benefits me when I inevitably succeed. OR.. more likely.. When I use my 450/450 combo and bust out a Harmony suros sidearm, this gun will support a flip flop swip swap playstyle that I enjoy very very much." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Horror Story
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "As a precision frame AR, you have a built-in horizontal recoil reduction so you are given the freedom to lean more into other attributes with your barrel and mod. For PvE, this is one of the few guns that can get both Demolitionist and Headstone to quickly regenerate grenade energy (the others being Unending Tempest from the Crucible, and Fire and Forget from Season of the Seraph)." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=177568179&perks=124408337,3523296417

// Horror Story
//notes:Clegmir (PvP / M+KB): "For PvP, adding just a bit more range to make sure you get the most out of your aim assist is where it’s at. Having a third column option for Elemental Capacitor is handy as that perk can have a substantial impact on the feel of the gun, especially if you don’t get something like Frenzy to max your Handling and Reload. Though there are a lot of damage perks in the fourth column, Stasis has an easy time creating shards so leaning into Collective Action is the play, I think." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It can roll Incandescent and Subsistence, but I think it shines with Golden Tricorn. You can make use of Heal Clip if you want a bit more healing but on solar hunter? This is going to be the bomb dot com." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3103255595&perks=2610012052,3619207468

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Both rolls for PvP are very similar except for two differences in stat investments. On controller you'll want a bit more stability, on MnK you can invest those stat points into range. Headseeker and Keep Away are the key points, but definitely keep an eye out for Arrowhead Brake to correct that recoil direction." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Jurassic Green
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] I'm looking for something a little more niche. Perp Motion gives stats when on the move (which this gun desperately needs) and Collective Action gives me a reason to be on the move with its enticing damage boost (that the gun also needs in PvE). Technically this job could be done by frenzy also, but if I build in such a way that both my subclass and guns benefit from pickups, it's a win win." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Technically this job could be done by frenzy also, but if I build in such a way that both my subclass and guns benefit from pickups, it's a win win." Recommended MW: Handling (M+KB) or Stability (Controller).|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Jurassic Green
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The combination of Subsistence and Incandescent came out last Festival, and I am glad that it is sticking around for this one as I wasn’t lucky enough to get one last go-around. Pairing Heal Clip and Frenzy is a handy pairing since the 100 Reload bonus will stack with the scalar from the frame when reloading from empty (bringing you down to a 1.03 second reload) Golden Tricorn and Collective Action are both incredibly straightforward to use with Solar 3.0, as well, offering noticeable damage boosts." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3103255595&perks=1820235745,4293542123

// Jurassic Green
//notes:Clegmir (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "On the PvP side, with the changes to Rangefinder and damage falloff, Killing Wind and Keep Away will be your stars, I think. The former is a “next kill” perk while the latter is to help you secure that first kill. There are a lot of viable rolls for this gun, so if you get one, try it out! I’ll be looking for Killing Wind/Encore and Keep Away/Headseeker, personally." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "In order to, in my humble opinion, get the most out of it in PvE, you'll want a base of 4 in your magazine. This way with Clown Cartridge there's a very high chance you'll be with 5 going into engagements. With Vorpal Weapon you won't need to hit crits in order to do good damage and you can take this solo without any drop in damage. Reload MW helps speed up those reloads getting you back to 4 or higher." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Eva spoiled us last year and gave us a god roll, snapshot and opening shot, right off the rip. This year she might not be so giving. If you're looking for max handling, fluted and a handling MW will get you there. You can also opt for Smallbore / Accurized Rounds / Range MW for max range. I am a little sour that Slickdraw was removed, especially after the buff." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3871226707&perks=47981717,957782887

// Mechabre
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "AJ is going to be confusing [...] I run a lot of high grenade regen builds, because of this I feel fairly comfortable relying on a damage boost like AJ on a weapon like Mechabre. It may not be as consistent as Vorpal, and it probably won't be the ideal for long boss phases, but for eliminating minibosses and champions, this will be my go to. Throwing an arcbolt to jolt the big guy and kill some trash mobs, giving me a damage boost and a pulse AOE around the target.. nice. Throwing a void grenade to debuff the target, killing some trash mobs, giving me the damage boost.. nice. Throwing a solar grenade, applying more damage to the target, killing some trash mobs, giving me a damage boost.. Nice. You get it. I doubt it would be anyone's first pick, but it is mine." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "It's a PvP sniper rifle in Destiny. Of COURSE you want snapshot/opening shot. You want to hit the headshots as quickly and cleanly as you can, this is the combo that will do that for you, it is tried and true. However, if you're a sniper that likes to find tricky lanes and make people say "Wha.. from THERE?" and maybe you don't mind a little extra ADS time, I'd give Keep Away a shot." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] in their current state it is challenging to suggest any sniper for use in PvE content. With Triple Tap generating ammo out of thin air, it is almost mandatory, and Vorpal is a nice “always on” damage perk to pair with it." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:Clegmir (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "For PvP, if you didn’t score the Snapshot/Opening Shot last go-around, you do have another chance at getting one! You also have the options of getting one with Keep Away and Discord as options. Ammo being refunded on takedowns is a very nice reward to deal with the potential lack of special ammo drops." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3871226707&perks=47981717,957782887

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Similar to how Geodetic HSM is the best sword for void mains, Acosmic GSp will be the best grenade launcher for void mains. Loose Change is a laughable perk on its own, but coupled with Destabilizing Rounds you won't need to rely as heavily on your abilities to get a whopping +50 reload speed. You'll be able to clear rooms with ease and be able to bridge your loadout into higher DPS weapons." Recommended MW: Blast Radius.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=413901114&perks=1119449540,2048641572

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Grenade launchers in PvP need to do two things. Hit their targets, and kill them. With high velocity coming at base with these grenade launchers you'll know your grenade gets to where it needs to go. Explosive Light will max out your blast radius and with how often you'll generate an orb the tricky part is actually securing heavy. Proximity Grenades will make this more forgiving. It might just take your heavy slot up from Wendigo." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=413901114&perks=3194351027,951095735

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] this combo just feels weird, and I like that. Cascade Point is really fun on a lot of things and I think there's a world where I run 3 cascade point weapons and see how fast I can run out of ammo. Enlightened Action will help keep the cycle going because unfortunately there is no Auto Loading Holster, so I figure a reload before you stow is going to be best. It should be fun, but it won't be winning any DPS prizes, and that is just.. Okay. It is okay." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "What do you want from a heavy GL in PvP? You wanna kill people fast and you wanna get back to slaying with your regularly scheduled arsenal. What is a core part of that arsenal? Abilities. Picture this.. You pick up heavy, you snag a cute little triple kill on B thanks to Proxy rounds and then you sprint to C so you can grenade the ding dongs you just slaughtered right as they spawn." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Heavy grenade launchers never felt right to me in PvE because machine guns handle ad-clear better, and for boss or champion damaging you have rockets and linear fusions. That said it is really hard to suggest something other than Quick Launch and Spike Grenades for PvE. For columns three and four you have Impulse Amplifier to help substantially with reloads and velocity, and Explosive Light which allows you to ignore blast radius entirely (while charged with orbs)." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=413901114&perks=3194351027,951095735

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:Clegmir (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Thankfully for PvP you do have access to Proximity Grenades. Explosive Light is handy given the ease at which you can generate orbs in the current sandbox, and the same holds true for elemental pickups with Collective Action."

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. This is the first rapid-fire Strand scout rifle (so you get an Alloy Mag-like 20% quicker reload animation when the magazine is empty), with best-in-class stats compared to other RFs in the kinetic slot. The recoil direction is a bit shonky, so Arrowhead Brake cleans that up a bit, but if you feel able to control it, Fluted Barrel adds to handling for general snappiness. You can choose from any of the combat effect rounds as the mag perk, depending on your preference, or Flared Magwell for better reload speed. For end-game use, Shoot to Loot as the first trait column support perk lets you gather ammo and orbs of power from a distance and Golden Tricorn can boost damage by 50% when the second stack kicks in - even if Strand is more difficult to proc, especially at the distance you'll be engaging at with a scout rifle. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing chunkier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed.

To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second, Golden Tricorn can help you make the most of the Strand melee abilities (you're going to be in CQC, with a shotgun), setting yourself up for +50% damage for chunkier minors and the occasional major, and Cursed Thrall explosions on a kill.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed.

For the mag perk, Assault Mag improves rate-of-fire or Tactical Mag increases the magazine by one and boosts reload speed. With a shotgun, you're going to be in CQC to proc Threat Detector as the first trait column support perk, to boost reload speed and handling or you could use Subsistence to continually reload your magazine as you get kills, if you're using this more for add-clear rather than single-target damage.

You can push out the range with the barrel perk - Hammer Forged Rifling or Smallbore both work well, and Ricochet Rounds pushes out the range a bit further and adds a bit more stability. There are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded and, once you've done that you can collect any generated elemental pickups to proc Collective Action (which is unusual to see on a Kinetic weapon) for a 20% damage boost.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The only other current lightweight SMG is Submission (which is a stat monster), so Showrunner's stats look a bit poor by comparison, but there are still some interesting PvE rolls worth considering. Lightweights give you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed as the frame bonus to start. You can push out the range with the barrel perk - on M&KB, Full Bore provides an extra 1.36m of ADS range, and any of the combat effect rounds pushes that out an additional 0.45m. For melee-focussed builds, in the first trait column as the support perk, there are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded or you can use Grave Robber to keep your mag topped up to make the most of Swashbuckler in the second, signature perk slot for 33% bonus damage. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. If you're looking for an arc shotgun, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. Start with a barrel perk that boosts handling - Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling both help a little - and Assault Mag improves the low rate of fire. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size for just picking up an ammo brick and then in the second column signature perk slot, to passively boost damage for end-game use you could use Trench Barrel, Frenzy or Collective Action.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name's a bit confusing - Psi (Ψ) is the 23rd letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Hermetic can mean something that's occult or mysterious and difficult to understand, relating to the legendary alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, tightly sealed, immune to external influence, or solitary like a hermit, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments.

Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter.

Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). Even if you have already got a sword decked out for Major or Boss damage, this already starts out doing more damage, so set it up as usual with a damage-boosting blade perk, ideally Jagged Edge, with Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk. Then pair Relentless Strikes to regene4rate ammo one every third strike in the first trait column as the support perk with Whirlwind Blade in the second column as the signature perk to boost damage up up to 30% at 10 stacks.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. We'll be using traits to boost handling and reload speed, so you can use the barrel and mag options to push up stability as much as you can to improve control. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. For M+KB, focus on range with your barrel and mag perks - stability is less useful and you can use trait perks to help boost reload speed. In the first trait column as a support perk, both Enlightened Action and Perpetual Motion boost gunfeel stats, while in the second as the signature perk, Collective Action or Surrounded are both solid damage boosting options. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod (only with Extended Mag).|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, so Fluted Barrel is the first choice for the barrel, with Corkscrew Rifling as an alternate choice. Appended Mag adds 2 "shots", or Tactical Mag adds one, but also helps with Stability and Reload Speed. In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads. Recommended MW: Stability (with Enlightened Action) or Handling (with Perpetual Motion), with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec), or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

// Eleatic Principle - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am sure by now most players have a good rapid-fire machine gun in their arsenal. Whether that's Retrofit Escapade, Planck's Stride, Recurrent Impact, Shattered Cipher, or reaching all the way back even a Thermal Erosion. That being said, the only direct competition Eleatic Principle has is with Planck's Stride, which I think Eleatic Principle blows Planck's out of the water. Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit. You won't have access to a reload or mag extending perk but you can make the shots easier to land with Zen Moment, Well Rounded, or after some kills even Heating Up."

The best PvE option is actually a throwback repeat to one of my first "DPS" snipers. Does anyone remember the Long Shadow with Rapid Hit and Triple Tap being the best we could have in Forsaken until Black Armory introduced us to Firing Line. Persuader is the best option for the older perk combo, but is still outclassed by other snipers in the current Sandbox.

If you can maintain all your Surplus stacks and invest the rest of your stats into range you'll have 87 range and 100 handling and reload speed.

// Deadpan Delivery - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)

Being able to have Overflow and One-Two Punch for the highest damage show followed by the most One-Two Punch... punches. The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with. Barrel Constrictor is an interesting perk for PvE as it makes sure all your pellets hit but it would be better paired with One-Two Punch instead of in the same column."

// Deadpan Delivery - MKB PvP (mkb,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "I'm not going to lie. I got excited by this shotgun for one mere fact. Slickdraw. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it has been mine for the past season. I have been slowly collecting Slickdraw weapons and changing crafted weapons to utilize Slickdraw. Now I know Slickdraw reduces your auto-aim cone size; it just means you have to be a bit more accurate when aiming. You can achieve a similar effect of Slickdraw by going with Arc Elemental Capacitor, Barrel Shroud, a Handling MW, and Quick Access Sling for 96 handling. This gives you a ready speed of 0.20s and an aim down sights speed of 0.23s. However just having Slickdraw drops you to the same ready speed and drops a hundredth of a second off of aim down sights. This means you can invest every other stat point into range. Bungie knew what they were doing when bringing in this weapon as Deadpan Delivery has the second lowest range stat of all Aggressive Frame shotguns even losing to the Uncommon Ded Nemoris II."

// Kept Confidence - PvE (pve,mkb,controller)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Kept Confidence is getting a lot of hype but is it worth it? We have some incredible powerhouses in the same slot. Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "PvP is another story. There's really only one or two ways this hand cannon can work. You can either opt for a "win more" perk like Killing Wind or a more neutral perk like Quickdraw depending on how you play. Neither are exceptionally better than the other, but the main pairing for both is Eye of the Storm. Kept Confidence could have been released as a static weapon like Epochal Integration and people would still use the same perks. Your barrel and masterwork choice is really up to preference if you want more stability, handling, or range." Recommended MW: Range or Stability. tags:mkb,pvp

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

// Nightshade - MKB PvP (mkb,pvp)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Nightshade in PvP has had an interesting run. From being a viable option in Vanilla, to being passed over with random rolls, to being an off meta choice in its revival, to being outclassed, and finally returning again. What a ride. Arrowhead Brake is again my choice in barrels, but if you can control the recoil direction you can certainly opt for other options. Ricochet Rounds is the best in slot whenever it is available so please choose that. High-Caliber Rounds can work but I find neutrally the bump in stability outweighs possibly flinching off my opponent. In the third column it is all about Keep Away. Being able to get a range bump for free is incredible. I prefer Kill Clip for an easier time 1v2'ing as I am usually in a bad situation, but Headseeker is better neutrally for any 1vX situation as it's always on. With my roll choices you can have 100 recoil direction with a counterbalance mod and 32m of in game range. Plenty to take advantage of the bonuses of Keep Away." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:mkb,pvp

// The Showrunner - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

The Showrunner has some great perks in Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction, Rangefinder if you're really looking for consistency at range, or more neutral perks like Well Rounded or Heating Up. However, the issue is really the frame we were given. Lightweight SMGs are not "in the spotlight." While I think this SMG can serve you well as a kinetic Funnelweb the perks to note aren't as strong. You can almost hit 100 range with Full Bore, Ricochet, Well Rounded 2x, and Fragile Focus, but that sacrifices Target Lock and Dynamic Sway Reduction for only 23m of range."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "In PvP Thoughtless is hands down better. Thoughtless can roll Snapshot or Headstone. Perpetual Motion for a better handling bonus. The only reason you want to use Locus Locutus over Thoughtless is due to Opening Shot being stacked on Keep Away. This way you can stack fully into handling as enhanced Opening Shot and Keep Away with Accurized Rounds puts you at a flat 100 range. While not the most optimal in most Guardian's eyes, it will still be a solid weapon to use." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:mkb,pvp

// Abyss Defiant - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Abyss Defiant is a high-impact auto rifle with arguably better perks than Ammit. Ammit doesn’t have reliable reload perks but can definitely maintain great damage. Keeping all that damage, bumping it up a tad but slowing down the fire rate is Abyss Defiant’s main claim to fame (that was a mouthful). Reconstruction and Subsistence with your flavor of damage perk will give you a reliable auto rifle to completely destroy whatever is standing in your way. The combination of Heal Clip and Kill Clip is nice to see." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Abyss Defiant - MKB PvP (mkb,pvp)

Kill Clip is the strongest perk you can use on Abyss Defiant, and your choice of accuracy booster will keep your bullets true. Reconstruction is here for anyone who dislikes reloading. Eye of the Storm will help in pure 1v1 fights but will fall off in any 1v2+ fights. Swashbuckler could be fun with any of the melee heavy builds to get an incredibly fast 0.67s TtK with 4 crits and 1 body. (psst, with Radiant it becomes a 4 crit kill at 0.50s TtK, just FYI)."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Did anyone ask for more rapid-fire frame pulses? It wasn’t on my Bingo card. Either way Oversoul Edict is here and requires Arrowhead Brake in order to even shoot reliably. Even with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance Stock you’ll be just shy of perfect at 94 recoil direction. Definitely great, but it’s a shame you’ll have to sacrifice a mod to make it feel like it’s shooting where you point it. In PvE Oversoul Edict doesn’t have the best reload perks. Keep Away and Precision Instrument are both great, Demolitionist can be strong on grenade heavy builds. The reason why I want a good reload perk like Outlaw or Rapid Hit is because of Voltshot. Being able to clear rooms with Voltshot is becoming more and more fun, but having to reload to get the zaps is less fun." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

It might not be the strongest for PvP but for PvE we have some incredible perks. Rewind Rounds and Precision Instrument will keep your damage going and grant you extra bullets refunded.

Bait and Switch can put out some incredible damage, and you get to pair it with either Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds, both will extend your magazine and allow you to keep the DPS going.

Here we have a case of “interesting but not incredible.” Being able to get both Pugilist and One-Two Punch is a fantastic combo, but I feel that most people will opt for Subsistence to forget what reloading is like. Demolitionist is good for grenade heavy builds and also for forgetting the reload animation. In the final column, One-Two Punch is the best in slot, but on a Strand ability focused build you can get away with Golden Tricorn for even more damage.

Being craftable, tying with the highest handling within its archetype, and being able to hit 100 range are just a few things that makes Swordbreaker interesting. You can choose a variety of different perks, you only need one handling perk and Threat Detector to hit 100 handling with an animation scalar, meaning you can invest the rest of your perks into range. Going with Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, and Opening Shot puts you at 91 range and 100 handling. Or you can opt for 100 range and 91 handling by swapping a few things around.

I guess I thought there were more. Word of Crota is an interesting 180. If you crafted a good IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 then you won’t need this one. If you didn’t craft one, then this will be a great option.

@description:Season of the Witch weapons with the Head Rush origin trait

// Kept Confidence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Tactical Mag, Loose Change, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus (Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking") has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool. If you haven't got one, then Arrowhead Brake improves handling and recoil direction, and Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum mag size of 5, and adds stability and reload speed. Overflow pushes you to an almost comical 11 in the mag on an ammo pickup, and Fighting Line boosts precision damage by 20% when you're close to at least two fireteam members - ideal for sustained damage phases against slow-moving or Divinity-debuffed bosses.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for support builds in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, and Enhanced Battery adds an additional shot. For support builds in end-game content, the new to season 21 Cure Clip as the support perk in the first trait slot, provides group healing on a reload after a kill - in the second, signature perk, trait slot Reservoir Burst adds 25% burst damage when the battery's full, adds the fun explosions, and needs a reload afterwards anyway to get it ready for next time, so works well as a combination. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

Backup PvE pick for Minor Spec add-clear in general content. Shapeable. The Eleatic Principle, is a philosophical argument that only items which have the capacity to affect or be affected are. Make of that what you will... Unfortunately, this is not the arc rapid-fire LMG you are looking for. If you really don't have a better arc option, then tidy up the recoil direction - you're putting out a lot of bullets - with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel, and High-Caliber, Ricochet or Armor-Piercing Rounds as the magazine perk. There's really nothing to get excited about with the traits - Ensemble in a fireteam, or Eddy Current if not, in the first trait column as the support perk, and then for bonus damage, Golden Tricorn or Adrenaline Junkie in the second trait slot as the signature perk. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. But then if you add Bipod as your second column signature perk, you can end up with 15 total rockets, which should be plenty for a damage phase, and Field Prep more than offsets the reload penalty. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

// A Distant Pull
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don’t think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"I am excited for this auto to pair with a void build using both Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for a self buff and add clear. Golden Tricorn pairs well if you get Volatile from your subclass or just want a stronger weapon. Dragonfly in the third column will get beefed up with Golden Tricorn so I can see some utility outside of direct void explosions that could be usable all the way up to GM levels." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Adaptive Frame(20) Solar Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Apex Predator is the best rocket launcher in the game. With enhanced Reconstruction you can almost always have a rocket ready to fire at any given time. With Explosive Light you get incredible amounts of damage and orbs are easy to make now. Bait and Switch is another great damage perk and does more damage, but I find Explosive Light easier to work with, especially with the new mod system revolving around orbs of power. Simple answer is, use Explosive Light if you’re lazy, if you’re trying to min-max use Bait and Switch." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// BrayTech Osprey
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. High-Impact Frame(15) Void Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "There is nothing more I want this season than BrayTech Osprey with Cluster Bomb and Chain Reaction. Seeing all those explosions, especially at once, will bring a smile across my face. I’d also like to see how it interacts with Lasting Impression. Do the clusters drop on the initial hit or, more likely, once the explosion goes off? There will be some obvious testing to do this season, but I want this rocket launcher for the sheer fun of it. Cluster Bomb might be useful again when coupled with Frenzy or Golden Tricorn’s damage increase." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bug-Out Bag
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(900) Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Chattering Bone
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Lightweight Frame(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Chattering Bone is showing its best footing yet. From a niche but underwhelming raid weapon to arguably the best in its archetype. Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone’s utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don’t know if the two of those perks would work together. It might be a case of the curated where you have damage that starts at the top half and once that goes away you have damage by the bottom half." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Comfort
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Aggressive Frame(25) Stasis Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Cold Comfort has some interesting perks but nothing stands out for me. It has a low blast radius with good velocity. If you crafted a Bump in the Night you already have a good Chill Clip rocket launcher at your disposal. I like that Bait and Switch is on more weapons now and Explosive Light has taken over my heavy slot, so while there’s an argument to upgrade past Bump in the Night, unless you get either of the other perks I would not worry about keeping a Chill Clip Cold Comfort." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Combined Action
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive Frame(120) Arc Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Combined Action is an interesting 120 for PvE. Hand cannons are not the most meta weapon to use in higher level PvE, but Voltshot combined with a low magazine can make it reliable and give you a reason to reload this hand cannon. No reload perk hurts Combined Action, almost making it unusable. Eddy Current exists, but won’t work with Voltshot, you need to be sprinting for 3 seconds to make it take effect." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Different Times
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Strand Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability. Which puts Multikill Clip as the best damage perk." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Epochal Integration
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Handling. Adaptive Frame(140) Solar Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "I don’t think Epochal Integration is a great example of a World Drop, but it is from Neumona. I guess that counts, right? Epochal Integration is a set roll, so it makes my life a lot easier. Incandescent and Stats for All are your choices for PvE, you can proc Stats for All after one explosion kill, if that explosion tags two more enemies. In regular activities this is often and makes Epochal Integration feel amazing, the issue is you cannot refresh Stats for all, and when it does go away it makes the gun feel 1/4 as good." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glissando-47
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Precision Frame(180) Strand Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "This is nice, it’s like Staccato-46 from a few seasons ago. It combines wonderful perks into a good frame and stat package. While none of Glissando-47’s stats are abnormal, the utility of the gun is already solid. Strand with Reconstruction or Overflow to never need to worry about reloading and paired with One for All or Box Breathing for better damage. Hatchling to better pair with Strand is another great combination. Scouts are designed to be safe options and this will feel incredibly strong to use." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Greasy Luck
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Shield Duration. Rapid-Fire Glaive(80) Solar Glaive Special Ammo.  "Greasy Luck sounds weird to say but is an all around good glaive. Lead from Gold works with the rise of double special weapon builds. Disruption Break is fantastic on a glaive for those ranged shields and keeps another good perk like Incandescent. It’s no longer an either-or. Redirection will be really strong on Greasy Luck if you use it right, I do not know how it interacts with the melee, so you’ll have to report back to me on that one use case." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Just in Case
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Adaptive Frame(20) Solar Sword Heavy Ammo.  "I was always a fan of the way this sword looked in PvE. It felt sleek and was the closest my Titan and Warlock got to the Wee-a-boo sword. Jagged Edge and Swordmaster’s Guard will give you the best damage and most often heavy attacks, if you prefer different play styles with swords either using them as your main add clearing weapon through Incandescent or as less of a boss killer you might want to use Burst Guard or Enduring Guard for your build." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Laser Painter
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Precision Frame(533) Strand Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo.  "Laser Painter has a fun name as you’re painting the target with a laser. Normally I don’t love Bungie’s names but this one earned a chuckle from me. I wish this was either a new archetype entirely or another aggressive frame. Regular linear fusion rifles just don’t feel as good to me anymore, and the huge perk pool just feels unrewarding now. You can craft Taipan and you’re basically done. Strand is nice for breaking the few shields, but the removal of match game belittles strand damage types for now." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Last Foray
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(72) Solar Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "Last Foray is a fodder sniper. It exists as both legendary shards and has some incredibly niche use cases. The first of which is a rapid-fire sniper with the damage of an aggressive with Cascade Point. You will certainly want to bump up the mag to at least 5 in order to take some advantage of it. Envious Assassin can also help you out here as both perks require other weapon kills to activate. The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot. I would hate to break a LfG build by using just bad weapons for it. Last Foray is good, but incredibly niche." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Last Man Standing
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(55) Solar Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Last Man Standing was an incredibly fun gun back in year 2. I loved the combination of Grave Robber and One-Two Punch to kill everything in Gambit Prime. Discord will be great if you can keep it up by continuously killing things. Swashbuckler will help with scaling up the damage or you can nuke red bars with One-Two Punch. It’s a shame we lost Grave Robber in the update." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Last Rite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(120) Kinetic Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Last Rite is very much a solid Ritual Weapon. It doesn’t exist as an incredibly strong scout, but it does come with a solid set of perks. Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man’s Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that’s necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It’s certainly one of the scouts of all time." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Loaded Question
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. High-Impact Frame(960) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Controlled Burst feels like a better Backup Plan. With full investments into charge time and Controlled Burst you could voop as fast as an adaptive or even a rapid-fire while maintaining or increasing your damage through surge mods and other means. Auto-Loading Holster is the obvious choice, but Overflow is incredibly strong for keeping up those bursts. Envious Assassin and Demolitionist are also great shouts as well.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(90) Arc Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "The new competitive weapon is a sniper, and while there are a lot of perks to look out for, I don’t think your main priority should be PvE. Snipers dedicated for PvE have ammo refreshing perks and a solid damage perk. Discord is nice, but require constant kills in order to keep up their utility. Snipers for damage don’t usually get constant flows of kills, and snipers for add clear (if you’re one of those odd balls, like me) need a better AoE damage perk. Mercurial Overreach is a PvP sniper." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Nation of Beasts
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(140) Arc Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Oh how things have changed. Nation of Beasts used to be the Fakebringer of Destiny 2 giving us Outlaw and Dragonfly all wrapped into one small curated package. Now that Fatebringer is truly in the game and other weapons have been granted Outlaw and Dragonfly (or even Firefly) what sets Nation of Beasts apart? Well, not a lot. It does have access to two very strong AoE perks in Voltshot and Dragonfly, and can increase its damage through Golden Tricorn. Discord pulls ammo from thin air and can help when in lower activities to bypass reloading." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"New Pacific Epitaph is our newest Stasis grenade launcher, at first I was disappointed with no Chill Clip, but then I saw why. A wave frame GL. This brings back up my excitement. Wave frame grenade launchers are arguably the best GL to bring into any content. They are easy to use, reliable, and unless the architecture messes with you very easy to secure multikills with. Collective Action is the best for subclass agnostic builds. Redirection will make easy work of bigger targets, and hordes building up that damage. Kill Clip is simple because you always have to reload to fire." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(600) Strand Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "It’s interesting to see the old Scathelocke model being used. I know many vets who loved this auto and I can’t blame them. Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today’s world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus’s Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds. The extra damage from the Threadlings are nice, but don’t pack as much of a punch without Strand to buff them." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Outlast
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Solar Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Outlast is a great gun with awful stats. Arrowhead Brake is almost mandatory for bringing up the low recoil direction, but you might also want to throw on a CB mod for 100 recoil direction. Flared Magwell would be good for the stat bump and reload speed. Feeding Frenzy is the best for not needing precision hits, but Outlaw is great in the event that you can handle the bounce. Kill Clip is an easy 25%, but you could also opt for solar grenade builds with Demolitionist, or Dragonfly for some better add clear." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Positive Outlook
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Precision Frame(450) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Positive Outlook was one of my favorite guns from Year 1. I still have mine in my vault with 4,600 kills on it. Nothing better than old reliable Kill Clip from Curse of Osiris. This new version gives us access to Golden Tricorn, Destabilizing Rounds, and even Repulsor Brace making it a really great void option for anyone drawn to the void. Ambitious Assassin isn’t a replacement for reload, but it does help make reloads feel a bit further away instead of making them faster." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Pressurized Precision
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Adaptive Frame(660) Strand Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Pressurized Precision is a great choice for a Strand fusion rifle. Discord will regenerate ammo for you as long as you get the kill, which will pair well with High-Impact Reserves or Vorpal for damage. Hatchling does not refund you ammo, but does pair well with Strand subclasses. Use whatever build you’d like." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Randy's Throwing Knife
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(260) Kinetic Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Randy’s Throwing Knife is back! My favorite little scout-auto love child. This time with random rolls!!! I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don’t even really care about viability, it will just be fun." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Rapacious Appetite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Aggressive Frame(750) Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You’re going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Sole Survivor
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(90) Arc Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "Sole Survivor was one of the first snipers to get Firing Line and it proved incredibly strong. Rapid Hit on a boss will keep your reload super quick. Field Prep will bump up your reserves and also increase your reload speed. Outlaw only works on kills so it will be better if you pair it with Voltshot. Focused Fury or Vorpal Weapon are interchangeable because Focused Fury needs hits to start getting high damage, but Vorpal Weapon does less damage but is immediate." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Spare Rations
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(140) Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Spare Rations is back, and I am underwhelmed. In order to make this hand cannon work in PvE you’ll want to use Rapid Hit for more stability and more importantly the reload bonus. Kinetic Tremors gives this hand cannon utility in higher tier activities. Vorpal Weapon can be used in lower tier activities against majors but I wouldn’t bring Spare Rations into a GM. Focused Fury will give you some great damage to clear red bars and majors if you wanted to, but Spare Rations just isn’t good enough for higher tiered activities." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Swarm of the Raven
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Rapid-Fire Frame(150) Void Grenade Launcher Special Ammo.  "There aren’t many places I see myself using a grenade launcher in PvE nowadays. Cascade Point is very fun and Full Court will net you some solid damage from afar, but I find myself using rockets over grenade launchers. Maybe for GMs or activities where ammo is a bit more scarce and using a rocket launcher wouldn’t be the best choice. Explosive Light really is carrying my weapons this season." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Targeted Redaction
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(120) Void Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Targeted Redaction has a subpar perk pool. You can make this hand cannon work with Outlaw for faster reloads and your choice of fourth column perk. Collective Action gives you great damage without having to spec into any specific subclass. Destabilizing Rounds is fun with stacking void debuffs. Explosive Payload will help mitigate some damage fall off, which helps hand cannons in higher level activities, it also adds some outgoing flinch. I would probably take this perk last as other perks will be better overall, but it does help in PvE." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Techeun Force
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Adaptive Frame(660) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Techeun Force is looking to be the best fusion rifle in the game. I don’t say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

A once great pulse has returned to take its throne. Move aside No Time to Explain, we don’t have time to explain how good Messenger is. Go away Graviton Lance, no one liked you before your multiple buffs. The king is back to retake the crown. Messenger needs a few things to make it the best roll possible, the first being Arrowhead Brake to bring up the low stability. Rapid Hit is the clear winner in the third column, but Outlaw is great if you don’t want the change in burst pattern depending on what stack of Rapid Hit you have. Kill Clip is an easy damage buff, and Kinetic Tremors is fun for the AoE. Desperado fell off a bit, but I would still use it in PvE if I were looking for a good time." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Draw Time. Lightweight Frame(580) Solar Combat Bow Primary Ammo.  "Tyranny of Heaven used to be the only solar bow in the game, and its sights are really odd. In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks. Incandescent does give you some great AoE but I find that not bumping up the bow’s innate damage might feel a bit lackluster in higher end activities." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Unlocking the patterns and getting them ready in the event of a buff would be wise, but quick killing weapons with good forgiveness coupled with Target Lock are the name of the game. Age-Old Bond kills quickly but does not have much in terms of forgiveness. Target Lock drops your 6 crit requirement down to 5 crit 1 body, not changing the time to kill, but making it ever so slightly more forgiving.

Arrowhead Brake with a CB mod brings the recoil to 100, so you can invest the rest of the fusion into range via Projection Fuse and Rangefinder. If you value kill chaining you could go for Reconstruction and Controlled Burst for never reloading and getting that 20% damage increase. Another niche use case would be Kill Clip and Kickstart for a nice 4 bolt kill, you’d have to be sprinting immediately after reloading but the enhanced version extending Kill Clip’s timer will help you out." |tags:pvp,mkb

The rise and fall of scouts are typically accompanied by a slower game, pulses and SMGs are dominant right now because you’re either playing passively or aggressively, there aren’t too many middle avenues.

// New Pacific Epitaph (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist (which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw), or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

// Greasy Luck (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill.

// Cold Comfort (PvE first-choice roll)
// Quick Launch, Impact Casing, Envious Assassin, (Explosive Light, Bait and Switch, Bipod)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs.

// (Hard Launch, Linear Compensator, Smart Drift Control), Impact Casing, Envious Assassin, (Explosive Light, Bait and Switch, Bipod)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. First, a velocity-boosting perk is the usual play for the barrel. Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. You'll need stability on a controller, so start with a stability barrel and a Stability masterwork. In the mag, the Combat Effect perks all provide utility. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk, and Frenzy in the second column as your signature perk. When everything's active, you'll be near 50 for stability, 100 Handling and Reload Speed, and have a 15% damage boost, which should make for a good kinetic slot SMG option if you need one.

If you can reliably hit crits, you can get 10 shots off without reloading with Triple Tap as a first trait column support park. As a second column signature perk, Focused Fury procs after three crits, giving you 7 shots with a 20% boost to damage for a sustained damage phase against a boss.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Until Its Return has decent stats in comparison to other kinetic slot rapid-fire shotguns and some reliable trait combinations. You can essentially ignore stability, handling and reload speed with the right traits, so you're left with range choices for the barrel, but Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 8 rounds, so there's no point looking at Appended or Extended Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, Threat Detector at two stacks maxes handling and reload speed, and increases stability to around 80 and Surrounded in the second column as the signature perk boosts damage by 40% (+47% for the enhanced version). Alternatively, Trench Barrel boosts damage by 50% for three shots after a melee hit.

Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives. However, it's the first hand cannon that can drop with Kinetic Tremors, so it might be worth keeping around in case a rework makes it a bit easier to proc. Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag will speed up the reload with ideally a reload speed masterwork (fast reloads keep the two damage perks uptime maximised), as well as adding in some stability and, in the latter's case, an extra burst. The old spicy Kill Clip/Rampage roll is still available, and is unique on a pulse rifle to this weapon as at S21. Proccing both gives a whopping 66.2% damage bump to go on a roll with. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use). If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well). Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities. Aggressive hand cannons have two main weaknesses - handling and reload speed. Fortunately, there are season 21 perk combinations that can help with that! Start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk. You can go one of two ways with the magazine - either look for a perk that helps with reload or enjoy a combat effect perk and let the traits do the heavy lifting. While there are additional reload perks in the first trait column, you shouldn't really need them, so Wellspring offers useful ability energy on kills as your support trait. Then, in the second trait column as your signature perk, Frenzy maxes out handling and reload speed when procced, as well as providing a solid 15% weapon damage boost. The Dream Works origin trait is useful in a fireteam to get the occasional overflowed magazine in a firefight.

So. start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk, and look for a perk that helps with reload in your magazine. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, the second tier of Golden Tricorn can be difficult to proc with Stasis - shattering a target that's frozen with a Glacier Grenade will do it or, if you're a Hunter, your Shurikens will also work. To support that, you could go one of two ways with your first column trait - Rapid Hit, to speed up the reload speed and take full advantage of the 50% damage boost, or Pugilist to get melee energy back so you can proc it again sooner.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies in end-game content. First thing to say, if you already have a rapid hit or lightweight Trench Barrel shotgun then just shard this. If you haven't, then Compass Rose can be your stopgap until you do. The stats are a bit of a mixed bag, but Handling is usually the play with shotguns anyway, so Corkscrew Rifling or Barrel Shroud improve that, as well as other useful gunfeel stats, and Assault Mag increases your rate of fire, and hence DPS, or Tactical Mag takes the mag size to six to let you get two full bursts of three shots off without reloading, and then helps with reload speed. Grave Robber can be useful, if you're near a crowd of minors to keep Trench Barrel procced, but if you're doing damage against a single target it's not much use, so Lead From Gold is more reliably useful.

(???  ???): First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game activities. Buzzard is a sidearm so it's likely to be less than optimal for end-game content, as you have to be very close to use one. It's got good stats overall, but the subfamily is all quite compressed. We can get pretty much every stat close to 100 with this particular roll, except for range so max that out with Full Bore in the barrel, a range Masterwork and any of the Combat Effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Encore wouldn't normally be under consideration, as it's mainly thought of as a PvP perk, but at four stacks it adds -5% accuracy cone growth for easier crits, 20 Range and 32 Stability. With Frenzy in the second trait slot as the signature perk procced, you end up with range of 86, stability of 89 or 99 (depending on the mag), and handling and reload speed at 100, as well as the useful 15% damage boost.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. High-Impact Rocket Launchers are meant for add-clear - they have the highest blast radius stat of the subfamilies and do middling damage - 10% less than Adaptives or Aggressives. And saying that, BrayTech Osprey has the worst stats in its subfamily. So, would you really use a rocket launcher for add clear? If the answer is yes (not sure it should be, but you go girl/boy/bot/peep), then use the barrel and mag to get to 100 blast radius without hurting velocity, and add Cluster Bombs and Chain Reaction for as much destruction as possible over as wide an area as possible.

And saying that, BrayTech Osprey (Adept) has the worst stats in its subfamily. But there might be an interesting roll for burst damage worth looking at anyway. Increase the velocity stat with the barrel and masterwork - Quick Launch and Hard Launch are the best options, and Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage. In the first trait column as the support perk, for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against a Boss, Field Prep for the extra reserves, which means you only have to run two reserves mods for the maximum number of rockets, and have the reload speed boost when crouched. In the second trait slot as the signature perk, Bipod could be very interesting - two in the mag, even with the loss of damage being offset by less need to reload. Maybe one to keep, just in case.

In the first trait column as the support perk, for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against a Boss, six rapid kills with another another weapon with Envious Assassin can get you five rockets in the mag (just don't ask how that works...). In the second trait slot as the signature perk, Bipod could be very interesting - at base, two or more in the mag, even with the loss of damage being offset by less need to reload, could still make for higher DPS than standard launchers.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities, particularly with a Strand subclass. While you've probably been melted a few times in PvP with The Immortal, it's still interesting in PvE as the first aggressive frame Strand SMG (the same subfamily as Ikelos).It's an absolute stat monster and the support perks can make it even more so, so we'll start with a range-boosting barrel, and any of the "Rounds" magazines. In the first trait column for the support perk, Threat Detector, Surplus (particularly easy to maintain with the extra melee charges from Strand), or Perpetual Motion will bump gunfeel stats up. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. In the second column, Hatchling is the natural choice to pair with a Strand subclass to generate Threadlings for add control.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for chunky add-clear use in general activities. The stats on Unexpected Resurgence make it the best adaptive glaive in the sandbox as at Season 21. Every Haft choice involves a trade-off but for most, the improved shield from Auxiliary Reserves, or maybe the range (which = projectile speed) from Supercooled Accelerator, are worth the penalty to reload speed, which we can get around. In the mag, Appended Mag for the extra shot (Extended doesn't do anything more for you), or Accurized Rounds for the range are options, and if reload speed is still a worry, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out. In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, or Subsistence will do the same on Projectile kills. The other new perk, Close to Melee, as the second column signature perk is great for those who like to wade in and glaive melee, increasing damage by 30% for 10s after a projectile kill. As an arc speacial weapon, you can also build into blinding and Jolting verbs with an arc subclass, and don't forget the Alacrity origin trait for solo content to pretty much max out range and reload speed, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Recommended MW: Range or Shield Duration, with a damage-boosting (Minor, Adept Big Ones or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Submachine guns are the perfect run and gun weapon. They have better range than a sidearm, and feel better for a more run-and-gun play style than an auto rifle. Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3559361670&perks=3708227201,4071163871

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "The Title doesn't need much to be a powerhouse in this meta. Rangefinder on a 750 is enough. But allowing you to duel multiple enemies within quick succession is another thing entirely. Without offering damage in the way of Kill Clip, the Title does give you Offhand Strike to take on multiple opponents while keeping your strafe speed up. Pairing this with a freehand grip would be my recommendation." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// The Title
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For me personally, I like to full send into one particular element, Void Subclass with Void Weapons, making the most of the keywords from the subclass. As such, I don't value Pugilist for void. I just don't like the melee abilities for the most part and that's okay. [...] I do wish Repulsor was a column 3 perk, but I understand why it isn't. All that combined with Classy Contender will make this weapon a mainstay on my Gyrfalcon hunter or Devourlock once Volatile Flow is no longer on our artifact." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=3559361670&perks=776531651,968510818

// The Title
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB): "Now you might be thinking "Stal, you put Arrowhead on all 3 rolls and haven't mentioned it. WHY. The gun has 85 RD, it doesn't need +30, +10 is enough if you absolutely want more, or you can use counterbalance." That's all true, but those don't also give +10 handling. That's only 5 less than Fluted, and I want my SMGs snappy. So if I can get more handling and a perfect 100 RD, I'm taking that every time." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb
dimwishlist:item=3559361670&perks=1359896290,1546637391

// The Title
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This year my Titan is going to lean heavily into Repulsor Brace. I am one of the few that enjoys the shield throw in PVE, and this combo will ensure that I always have one ready. Endless shield throws and volatile enemies guarantee that my Titan can rest easy knowing he will always have an overshield to protect him." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Title
//notes:Sneecher (PvP / M+KB): "For those hoping for/dreading an energy slot version of The Immortal, Target Lock is nowhere to be found. Despite that, the gun still has the same strong combo of Dynamic Sway and Rangefinder. Perpetual Motion is also a great choice for people who prefer that. I don’t love Threat Detector on aggressive frame SMGs, since the base ADS range is outside of Threat Detector’s activation range, but if you love it, go nuts." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb
dimwishlist:item=3559361670&perks=1359896290,2846385770

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Speedy reloads and threadlings? Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1168162263,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Moving Target is arguably the best in slot for the third column, and kill clip will allow for some spicy three taps. Definitely keep an eye out for this one. Again Arrowhead Brake is recommended for allowing you to focus less on controlling the recoil and more about crits. Steady Rounds will bump up the stability meaning you have less jump each shot. You shouldn't have to worry about the range drop as scouts have different metrics for range. Handling or stability for masterwork depending on how fast you like your weapons. [...] You won't necessarily need the range boost, but you don't need the stability boost from steady rounds either. So use that knowledge for what you'd like. There's no bad mag perk other than extended mag." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pvp,mkb
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1015611457,588594999

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Everybody is going to be looking for Hatchling on this thing, so I'm not unique in that respect. A strand scout is new and unique, so leaning into that newness and uniqueness is great, absolutely worth it. However.. I am not going to be looking for Outlaw, instead I'm looking for FTTC. Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw. Obligatory Arrowhead because even on a scout rifle, 54 RD is brutal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1354429876,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB): "I just need to shoutout that Kill Clip is right there in slot 4 also, and that would be great too. However, my thought process with this roll is that I want to make any given engagement as easy for me as possible (High stab, Zen Moment) while also being as much of a nuisance for the enemy as I can (Low flinch intake, Explosive Payload) So while I do think the KC 3 taps will go hard, I'm here to be a menace, not a slayer. [...] While MnK won't actively benefit from Stability as much as Controller, the flinch resist is gonna be a big deal for this roll to work. So it may feel strange at first, but trust the process" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=2387244414,3038247973

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A new Strand weapon enters the fray! I'm always excited to get a new weapon type to add to my toolbox, and this weapon immediately gives us the Outlaw/Hatchling combo I've been waiting for (I still love you Round Robin). I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon. If you are intent on using this for GMs, you'll want Explosive Payload or maybe even Focused Fury instead." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=1389546626&perks=1168162263,831391274

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvP / M+KB): "PC players don’t need stability as much as I do, so you can trade all of those stability boosts for range, and really let the cones do the work for you. Outlaw and Kill Clip are a tried and true combo, so you can’t really go wrong here. Once again there are a few combos that work in PVP, so use whatever feels best for your playstyle." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

@title:Season 20 Guardian Games weapons
@description:Lightfall Guardian Games weapons with Classy Contender origin trait

// The Title (PvE first-choice roll)
// Full Bore, Ricochet Rounds, Threat Detector, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt.

In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). If you're still finding the recoil difficult, you can proc all 5 stacks of Zen Moment with just three hits, in the first trait column as your support perk. If you're not finding it a problem, than Fourth Time's The Charm is always welcome to extend your mag size, or Outlaw works well for a snappy reload after a crit kill. Then Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk builds into the Strand toolkit - just come to peace that they're likely to be spawned too far away to join you, if you're a Warlock. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// Acasia's Dejection
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(1000) Solar Trace Rifle Special Ammo.  "Acacia's Dejection is a super fun trace rifle with Reconstruction and Target Lock. Paracausal Affinity is great for instant 20 percent damage. Depending on what you’d like to use this trace rifle for you can either blitz majors and champs with it or clear out rooms of enemies with incredible damage. I would definitely farm for this trace rifle." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(300) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Allied Demand is extremely similar to Buzzard, however, there will be no adept mods to bring up stats or damage in PvE. Rapid Hit is by and large the best perk to look for. Subsistence is also good if you’re in lower tiered PvE. Frenzy is the best in slot perk with either third column perk. Multikill Clip pairs better with Rapid Hit than Subsistence." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Astral Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(55) Kinetic Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Astral Horizon graces yet again. No quickdraw but that’s okay. One-Two Punch and Pugilist are the best combos together, but lack a reliable reload perk. Surplus and Slideshot both reload your weapon but it’s not the same as Auto-Loading Holster or Grave Robber." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Autumn Wind
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(540) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Autumn Wind is a fun return to our sandbox. Arrowhead Brake is a must have on these pulses. 93 recoil direction is near perfect for PvE, but I would hesitate to bring a rapid-fire frame into higher end PvE. Demolitionist and Frenzy are great on grenade heavy builds. Freny brings up the reload so you won’t have to invest hard into that one particular stat." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Basso Ostinato
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(140) Void Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Basso Ostinato is an interesting shotgun. We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Battle Scar
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Lightweight(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "It's interesting to see this pulse come back this season. Battle scar was not utilized much in year 1, this season it has some utility in Kinetic Tremors for clearing groups. If you're hurting for a good PvE pulse this will suffice. There are much better dedicated rolls, but this will do just fine." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bite of the Fox
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(72) Kinetic Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "Bite of the Fox finally returns to us in a better capacity. Envious Assassin and Vorpal Weapon will bump up your magazine and give some incredible damage. It’s not a dedicated high-dps weapon for raid bosses, but could be better for GMs or general strikes." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Briar's Contempt
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Aggressive(533) Solar Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo.  "Briar’s Contempt might be better than Stormchaser or Fire and Forget. Being able to slot Adept mods is incredibly useful. That alongside Reconstruction and Frenzy could make for a solid DPS weapon. It loses 5 percent of damage without Firing Line but does make up for that in non-precision damage. Firing Line only deals bonus precision damage. Will the extra magazine make up for the lack of damage? I know Adept Big Ones will certainly make up for it. Being able to use this fusion against any beefy enemy regardless of spec mod you have on is perfect." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Buzzard
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(300) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "I loved Buzzard for the few seasons we had it. Now that it can roll Adept mods I love it even more. In PvE you can roll Kinetic Tremors which will give Buzzard a bit more utility in higher-end content. Overflow is arguably one of my favorite perks in the game. Perpetual Motion also needs you to be mobile, easy with a sidearm as you have to get close. Compulsive Reloader is easy to use but falls off quickly with the low magazine size." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Caretaker
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Adaptive(60) Solar Sword Heavy Ammo.  "Valiant Charge is an interesting new perk that launches you if you block which could be fun for speed runners. Duelist’s Trance is great for keeping guard up. Burst Guard keeps your damage taken low and allows you to keep taking damage for longer." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Circular Logic
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(450) Strand Machine Gun Heavy Ammo.  "I am glad we are getting more 450 machine guns. They just feel the overall in PvP, PvE, and PvEvP. They might not always be meta but they feel good to shoot without investing a lot into their stats. If you run Arrowhead Brake you will have perfect recoil, Envious Assassin will overflow the magazine. Target Lock or Vorpal Weapon will be dependent on whether or not you use this as a boss killer or multi-tool. You could also make this your add-clearing machine with Hatchling and Feeding Frenzy." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Coronach-22
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(600) Solar Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "If you ever felt like the CALUS-Mini Tool wasn't enough for you. Then Coronach-22 will be perfect for you. A slightly higher range slower rpm auto instead of submachine gun. You can roll Envious Assassin if you swap weapons a lot, or Feeding Frenzy for pure reload speed. Incandescent for clearing rooms and Target Lock for damage against champs or majors." |tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=355382946&perks=2779035018,4293542123

// Dark Decider
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(720) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "While I like Dark Decider coming back and more Veist-Rapid Fire Frame autos is never a bad thing. They are incredibly fun to use. It harps back to Vanilla when I used Hollow Earth nearly every day. A better version in this economy? Heck yeah. Golden Tricorn with an Arc subclass will give you damage that scales up to almost GM level activities. Dragonfly gives you some great add clear potential with Veist Stinger to keep up the shooting, pair that with Subsistence and you can almost non-stop firing. Titans Rejoice a legendary Sweet Business that has ‘splosions!" |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Death's Razor
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Vortex(20) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "I love that warlocks get a spin-to-win sword. I would love to see class agnostic heavy and lightweight frame swords, but I digress. For Death's Razor you'll want similar rolls to your old Falling Guillotines. The difference would be Valiant Charge for a bit more zoom. Duelist's Trance for better charge rate. Or Destabilizing Rounds for better add clear while maintaining some good damage. Lots to do with more utility over Guillotine which was only damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Dimensional Hypotrochoid
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Compressed Wave(120) Stasis Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "I have been having a lot of fun with this grenade launcher. The only thing keeping me from using it more is Bungie’s floor textures sending the wave in every direction but the enemy. Envious Assassin and Chain Reaction can be really fun for using this grenade launcher as a mock add-clear weapon when swapping between weapons. Field Prep and Vorpal Weapon would be interesting for boss damage if the boss is reliably on the ground. I might update this once Dimensional Hypotrochoid gets a buff." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Ecliptic Distaff
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Shield Duration . Adaptive(55) Void Glaive Special Ammo.  "Well this is our vendor weapon this season. Replenishing Aegis will reload your weapon which will help continue your Destabilizing Rounds to keep clearing rooms of enemies." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Exalted Truth
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(140) Void Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Exalted Truth has few perks going for it in PvE. Outlaw and Repulsor Brace are good on void builds but fall off immediately on anything else. Frenzy is good for neutral damage and Multikill Clip is best used where you can one-shot most enemies and is overkill at best." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Lightweight(20) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Ninja swords go! Having access to Valiant Charge in the third column makes this the sword to come up in a while. It's unfortunate that Goldtusk is hunter specific as getting Valiant Charge with another great add clearing perk like Chain Reaction gives this sword no choice between movement or add clear. One for All is also great for dealing better shatter damage against bosses." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Hand in Hand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(55) Arc Shotgun Special Ammo.  "I used the crap out of Hand in Hand back in Forsaken for solar kills during my grind for Luna's Howl. Now it's an aggressive frame and arc. Weird how that glow up happened. Golden Tricorn with any of the arc subclasses will keep your high damage up constantly. The issue is the third column. Ensemble will be with a group and as long as you're near them. Slideshot can be good for solo play. Dual loader would be good if you know you'll only be reloading outside of combat." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Harsh Language
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Wave(72) Void Grenade Launcher Special Ammo.  "It's fun to see more Truthteller clones out in the wild. Harsh Truths competes with Truthteller and all the other wave frame GLs. Truthteller served me very well in a lot of GM attempts so I'm expecting a lot from this GL. Disruption Break was extremely strong and Destabilizing Rounds looks to be even stronger. Especially paired with Envious Assassin for a larger magazine you can two shot without even getting a kill with this GL." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

While I never got behind this weapon I am upset that Hung Jury SR4 has had three different versions in D2 and its original version in D1. Give me back the Black Armory weapons please and thank you. In terms of this new-new version of Hung Jury SR4 you will want Kinetic Tremors or Firefly for your AoE damage. Frenzy gives you some great damage coupled with any spec mod. Rapid Hit is a bit overkill for reload but gives decent stability. Arrowhead Brake brings up the recoil direction to 100 for an easy shooting experience." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(55) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Surrounded being baked into itself is extremely fun for shotguns like the Imperial Decree. Your damage is already strong per shot and you're making it even stronger with a spec mod, surge mods, and surrounded. Auto-Loading Holster is for stow and shoot. But Surplus can bring up your handling and reload speed if you don't use your abilities often." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Irukandji

"Truthfully I don't think we need another rapid-fire frame sniper with Firing Line. We've had a few and the IKELOS sniper was craftable. Irukandji does have access to Veist Stinger for potentially more shots but I wouldn't rely on that being the deal breaker." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(500) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Iterative Loop needs better recoil direction. You might almost want to run counterbalance mod on it at all times. Accelerated Coils bumps up your damage per second. Lead from Gold is a very fun build and this could be a great major / champ killer. Compulsive Reloader and Voltshot would make a great pairing and clear rooms quickly.

// Jorum's Claw
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(390) Solar Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Hey hey, a “new” not so new weapon. Unlike the last few this is truly a reprised version. Jorum’s Claw is a fun pulse that needs Arrowhead Brake to even be considered useful. In PvE you really don’t have a lot of choice. Outlaw and Arrowhead Brake are required. A mag extending perk is useful but not required. Frenzy does limit the need for outlaw but there aren’t really a lot of perks in that column I would take. Golden Tricorn has become one of my favorite perks to recommend for the sheer damage coupled with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Frenzy is tried and true and also brings up your reload to match.

It doesn't do anything special to set itself apart from other grenade launchers in its class but it is craftable. Meaning you can create your 5/5. If you like pure damage you can roll with Field Prep for faster reloads and more reserves and your choice of damage perks. Full Court for longer ranged damage phases, Explosive Light stacked with surge mods, and Vorpal for plain Jane damage.

Father’s Sins does have lower zoom and is craftable for enhanced perks / enhanced intrinsic perk. The good news is that Irukandji is Stasis and Father’s Sins is Void so they won’t compete. In that realm you’re looking at Praedyth’s Revenge which can get adept mods (should you have the adept version). If you have the adept version you can have incredibly high stats, 100 handling and 100 aim assist. Irukandji is great if you don’t have either of those options, but Father’s Sins is craftable and comes from the Witch Queen DLC. Certainly obtainable." |tags:pvp,mkb

// Senuna SI6
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): Recommended MW: Range. Omolon Adaptive(491) Stasis Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Senuna SI6 is arguably the best three-burst sidearm. Slickdraw gives you 100 handling. A counterbalance mod gives you 99 recoil direction. You can then invest entirely into range as Omolon Fluid Dynamics will give you your stability. The only issue is the fourth column perk. Headstone is great in 3v3. Elemental Capacitor can bump up your stability on void, or forgo a counterbalance mod on Stasis. If you jump a lot then Strand could be a great option for you. Headseeker is another good option. Ideally I would run Headstone just for locking down that position and having some cover as well. Certainly a gun I will farm for and then throw in my vault to use on random loadout shenanigans." |tags:pvp,mkb

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Rufus's Fury is no different and will be most people's choice for a Strand primary, and will probably only get better when the additional fragments arrive. Although, at 56, the recoil is pretty up-and-down, Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk takes the Recoil Direction to an even more controllable 86 and adds Handling. Flared Magwell or Ricochet Rounds add Stability and Reload Speed or Range and Stability in the magazine. Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with signature perks like Target Lock, where the refilled magazine allows you to reach the higher damage stacks, for damage against bulkier enemies or Frenzy for a general 15% damage bump. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

// Nessa's Oblation (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Tactical Mag, Demolitionist, Paracausal Affinity
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Light subclass synergy against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Tactical Mag boosts your mag size, stability and reload speed, so is a bit of a no-brainer for the magazine perk. As your first trait column support perk, Demolitionist means grenades (remember, it's 20% grenade energy for special weapon kills), which means you should have an easy way to proc Paracausal Affinity for 20% bonus damage for 6s to clear beefier Minors, and Majors. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius (let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion), or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel. If you do catch a chunkier enemy, Spike Grenades is nice for a little extra impact damage, and then the unique combination of Chain Reaction as your first trait column support perk - let's face it, it's unusual to have it as a support perk - and Hatchling as the signature perk in the second trait column. Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast.

// Mykel's Reverence - Mykel's Reverence (mnk,pve)
//notes: For PvE, Reload Speed becomes one of the most desired stats for Mykel’s Reverence. Hence, Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag are the two best options. The choice of barrel matters significantly less for PvE and isn’t something to worry about. However, the go-to option is still Hammer-Forged. The best column 1 perks are Thresh or Pugilist, and the best column 2 perks are Swashbuckler and Hatchling. Hatchling is the best choice if you are using a strand subclass.|tags:mnk,pve

// Mykel's Reverence - Mykel's Reverence (mnk,pvp)
//notes: Due to its high base stability, you want to focus on getting as much range as possible. This makes Hammer-Forged Rifling, Full Bore, or Small Bore the best barrels. For magazine options: Ricochet or High-Caliber Rounds for the extra range with bonuses to stability/increasing flinch, respectively. The best perk in the first column is Perpetual Motion due to the bonus effects it grants when moving. The second column of perks has a wider range of perks that can be used. For general use, Swashbuckler or Tap the Trigger are the go-to options. Strand users can find great value in the Hatchling perk.|tags:mnk,pvp

// Rufus's Fury - Rufus's Fury (pve,mnk)
//notes: This auto rifle is a powerhouse in PvE. For main stats, you’ll want the same ones we mentioned above—stability and range. Therefore, the first two columns of traits won’t change. As for the perks, you can go a couple of different ways here. Reconstruction and Target Lock won’t do you wrong if you want a pure workhorse weapon. But if you’re looking for excellent Strand synergy, Demolitionist and Hatchling is easily the best choice.|tags:pve,mnk

To start, you’ll want to focus on high stability and range; Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, and Ricochet Rounds are great for this. Perpetual Motion is best for Perk One, while Target Lock is great for your second.|tags:mnk,pvp

// Briar's Contempt - Briar's Contempt (mnk,pve)
//notes: DPS is the best-suited job for Briar’s Contempt inside PvE. Fluted Barrel is still the best option due to the large increase in handling. This means a faster swapping speed which can be crucial to maximizing DPS. For the magazine, either Liquid Coils or Ionized Battery are the best choices. Liquid Coils grant an increase in impact, resulting in higher damage per shot. Ionized Battery adds an additional round to the magazine, which helps during longer DPS phases. The best perks in column 1 are Rewind Rounds, Demolionist, and Reconstruction. All three perks grant reloading effects/increase total magazine size, which removes/lowers the need to manually reload the gun. This is great for sustained damage. Frenzy and Focused Fury are the best column 2 perks due to the increase in damage that they provide. Surrounded can situationally be the best option, but the requirements to activate it can be difficult.|tags:mnk,pve

// Briar's Contempt - Briar's Contempt (pvp,mnk)
//notes: For PvP, handling and accuracy are the two most important factors for a linear fusion rifle. Hence, Fluted Barrel is the best barrel due to the large bump in handling. Particle Repeater or Projection Fuse are the best magazine choices due to the flat bump in stats they give to stability/range, respectively. For column 1 perks, Keep Away is the stand-out choice. Keep Away provides several buffs for keeping your distance, most noticeably an increase in weapon accuracy.

Quick or Hard Launch and Spike Grenades are no-brainers for the first and second columns, greatly benefitting your damage and velocity.

@description:Season 20 new and reprised weapons with the Field Tested or Foundry origin trait

// Battle Scar (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds), Shoot to Loot, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

To improve your gunfeel, in the first trait slot as you r support perk, Perpetual Motion adds a decent bump to handling, stability and reload speed, or if you want extra range then Keep Away boosts that, reload speed and accuracy. Osmosis, as your signature perk in the second trait column is fairly rare and will pick up any of the energy synergies from your subclass (say, volatile rounds when that's procced by a void ability) - if you haven't already got a pulse rifle with the perk, then this would be worth hanging on to.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

In the first trait column Envious Assassin can give you up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon, but Field Prep, Threat Detector or Stats for All are all worth considering as a support perk. Void subclasses provide a great toolkit to trigger the second stack of Golden Tricorn for 50% bonus damage, in the second trait column for your signature perk.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently (as at v7.0.0.6) in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much). As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling (and boost reload speed too). Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Stasis synergy in general activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further. To pair with your Stasis aspects and fragments, Headstone is your choice for signature perk in the second trait column.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL.

With one eye towards building a weapon around Voltshot (this is the first GL with Voltshot as an option, although the jury is still out on whether that's a good idea or not) as the signature perk in the second trait column, we'll need to make the reload as fast as possible. High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too.

Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your pick of the support perks, Auto-Loading Holster lets you empty the magazine and reload while you're swapped to your DPS special weapon to rinse and repeat, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot. This combination should make you a bit of a walking tank in add-dense areas, as long as you have ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo.

// Raconteur - Raconteur (pve,mkb)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Unsurprisingly, the favorite here is still Archer's Tempo. [...] I don't think there's anything in the 1st column besides maybe Stats for All that I care about whatsoever. Maybe Wellspring. Shoot to Loot is definitely an option for you Master and GM content runners though, more of a specialty thing, not really needed for general content. In the second column, Explosive Head for that PvE damage bump is pretty solid, along with Headstone for any sort of Stasis builds that you might wanna be using if you are not using Ager's Scepter or Verglas Curve the new season 20 bow for whatever reasons. Are things like Rampage and Successful Warm-up also ok, of course they are, they are totally reasonable perks to use as well. But the roll I'm looking for here would be Archer's and Explosive, unless I'm running Stasis where I want Headstone. Go for some form of Arrow Shaft and Tactile or Agile string, draw time masterwork is fine."|tags:pve,mkb

// Regnant - Regnant (mkb,pve)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "First column, Auto-Loading or Envious Assassin are the top choices, but for different reasons. You want Auto for any sort of weapon swap meta or in stuff where you want the convenience of an auto reload, you want Envious for times where you need the ability to lay into something with as many grenades as humanly possible. It varies from activity to activity in terms of what you actually want or need though. Second column, the choice is quite clear: Explosive Light. Orbs drive one of the main engines of buildcrafting right now and therefore, orbs of power should basically be everywhere, which means you might as well just be getting a near permanent damage bonus to your GL. The only other thing I'm considering is Destabilizing Rounds, which is purple Incandescent more or less, but I am STILL not sold on the perk just yet, not until I try out some void build stuff in the future. Spike Grenade is a good choice provided you're hitting targets directly with grenades, but most other things aren't too great, and then we'd like some sort of Blast Radius increase, with the Masterwork being up to you for the most part. Handling is good for both Auto-Loading and Envious, velocity is fine, blast radius is fine, probably not reload though."|tags:mkb,pve

// Prodigal Return - Prodigal Return (mkb,pve)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Gonna be tough to beat out Salvager's Salvo [...] I think a lot of people are gonna see Envious and Voltshot and will just call it a day, I dunno about that though. If you do wanna go with Envious, then I would say Voltshot has a bit of negative synergy. Voltshot asks you to reload a lot,but the whole point of Envious is to sort of use it like an auto-loading holster type perk. I'd probably pick something else like Demolitionist, even if Demo only gets 10% energy per kill on special GLs. Lead From Gold is also not too bad of an idea here to keep ammo counts high. If you DO want Voltshot, then I'd want stuff that increases reload speed to just lay out as many grenades as possible, even going as far as going Field Prep if you remember to crouch, although Field Prep is not the most condusive perk if you use a GL like I do, which is a lot of jumping up and down. Even Threat Detector, lot of content out there now that has you surrounded by enemies. Definitely gotta take blinding err, disorienting grenades they're called now, something like disorient/envious/demo works quite well. If you want Voltshot, focus on reload speed. LoI don't think you need Spike nades here, this isn't a power GL."|tags:mkb,pve

// Perpetualis - Perpetualis (pve,mkb)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Obviously the main appeal here is Hatchling for any sort of Strand based builds, although I'd argue that Hatchling is more important on Warlock than Titan or Hunter. [...] Envious Assassin seems very appealing. Loads more ammo into the gun, but you gotta get some kills with other weapons and they gotta be rapid kills. If you're using a machine gun, it's a good perk on a different gun, like this one, but I don't think it's the instalock perk that some people may think it is. It's good though. Keep Away is another solid option, but I think it kinda depends on the content. You're using an auto-rifle, you do need to be SOMEWHAT close to things and that might prevent this perk from activating. Elemental Capacitor, ehh, not for strand in my opinion, for PvE anyway. I guess I'm probably going Envious still, the rest of the roster is eh. Second column, Hatchling if you're doing a Threadling build, but if you're not, it's not like it's the worst choice you can possibly make and I think a lot of people are gonna go for it anyway. Target Lock I'm not sold on unless you're doing higher level content where things aren't gonna die as quickly. I would say don't sleep on Golden Tricorn because Strand can proc Golden Tricorn x2 REALLY easily and that's a very significant damage boost that can have a lot of up time. Demolitionist is also not too bad of an idea, but if I'm getting Demo, then I'm gonna use the raid auto, which feels like a laser beam. Go for Arrowhead Brake, Accurized and Range masterwork."|tags:pve,mkb

//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Something that looks quite appealing is Envious Assassin and Reservoir Burst. You overflow the magazine, you're getting bonus burst shots, what's not to love about that? And Envious makes a bit more sense on this gun vs. a primary weapon because the primary weapon is the thing you'll be using the most, at least in theory anyway. Or you're using a machine gun, but the concept is the same. The only other thing I'd want is maybe trying out Incandescent instead of Reservoir Burst for some scorch plays, killing two enemies at a time can spread scorch quite quickly. If you wanna do some PvP, Firmly Planted is the way to go in the first column. Arrowhead Brake, Accelerated Coils or Enhanced Battery and masterwork... reload speed probably."|tags:mkb,pve

Second column, Valiant Charge is leading the way right now and beyond the Eager Edgelords trying out some new tech, I'm not exactly sure the viability of this outside of the movement tech world. Pretty much everything else that you can get on this thing is definitely viable in some form. Assassin's Blade, more damage after kill, Incandescent, it's Incandescent and on a sword, it's probably gonna treat you pretty well. Surrounded, more damage, One for All, more damage, I love One for All in general. If I'm making this thing, I'm just going like Relentless Strikes and One for All or something because I don't guard with swords, I go unga bunga with swords, just swipe swipe swipe until they die or I die.

There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column - Envious Assassin is much better on a Special or Power weapon, but it's worth it for the occasional overfilled mag. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on rapid kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get.

To take full advantage of Target Lock, to burst down beefier minors, look for as large a magazine as you can and combine with Fourth Time's the Charm.

title:Datto's early thoughts on lightfall weapons.
description:Original video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk

//Round Robin
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Round Robin is a strand, 120 RPM hand cannon. We have a lot of new perks with Lightfall and arguably one of the top rolls on this gun consists of 2 new perks: Keep Away and Hatchling. Keep Away is the opposite of Threat Detector, you get bonus stats when there is NOTHING near you, minus allies. Hatchling is where precision final blows or rapid non-precision kills spawn a Threadling at the target's location. In the first column, we have soem good stuff, Keep Away, Subsistence and Envious Assassin, another good perk, where rapidly killing targets with other guns will transfer ammo into this gun from reserves and this can overflow the magazine. At the moment, I feel like this is much more of a special weapon type perk, but I wouldn't begrudge you for using it as we feel it out. The second column has Hatchling, Kill Clip and Golden Tricorn. Golden Tricorn is definitely a bit better of a pick now thanks to 3.0 subclasses and the general up time you can have on grenades and melees nowadays. I think Hatchling is quite popular right now because it's new and it links up with Strand and there are Strand fragments to buff Threadlings, so if it fits with your build, it is certainly worth a try. Threadlings WILL proc Golden Tricorn if they are from Threadling Grenade. This gun just kicks pretty hard, it's a 120 so that makes sense, so I'm gonna be going with stability based minor perks and masterwork. I have heard good things about this gun in PvP with Keep Away and Kill Clip, but I have not tested it myself just yet. Again, it does kick pretty hard. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=43s

//Volta Bracket
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Volta Bracket is a Strand Sniper, 72 RPM so a slower one, gonna be lower DPS, but higher total damage on average. I think the only PvE roll here is for the sniper copium addicts and that is Triple Tap or Envious Assassin and Firing Line. Pretty much any other option on this gun is for specialty use only. If you wanna use Hatchling for some sort of a build, cool, but snipers haven't received any significant changes and are still not very popular picks for most of PvE right now. Looking at range based perks or magazine based perks if used for single target damage purposes. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=150s

//Phyllotactic Spiral
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Phyllotactic Spiral is an arc energy pulse, 340 RPM. This thing feels like it can get some pretty decent rolls, but I think Voltshot for PvE is just too nice to pass up. If you're going Voltshot in the second column, I'm gonna call an audible for lower end PvE content and go with Compulsive Reloader, since I feel like the goal with Voltshot is either hitting a big target with jolt and tagging a bunch of stuff around it with the AoE portion, which would make CR not good, or just mowing through little dinker enemies and constantly proccing it over and over. If you're doing the second thing, I'd try out Compulsive. In higher end content, I'm probably looking at Keep Away, maybe Tunnel Vision, but I don't think that's super important in PvE. Kill Clip and Frenzy are also on this thing, but I think Voltshot is just too good. I'm looking at range or reload speed for masterwork and then your choice of either magazine or range minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=192s

//Iterative Loop
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Iterative Loop is an arc fusion rifle, rapid-fire frame, so 500 charge time. This is the first time I think we've seen a fusion with Voltshot, but honestly, besides Demolitionist, I'm not too thrilled with many of the other second column perks anyway, so we're probably going Voltshot regardless. In the first column, we got options, Lead From Gold, Killing Wind, but again, I'm calling an audible in Compulsive Reloader. You want to proc Voltshot a LOT on guns with Voltshot and fusion are pretty good at killing stuff in the top half of the magazine. But, I can understand if you wanna roll with something else. Reload masterwork as well, with Accelerated Coils or Enhanced Battery and probably Arrowhead Brake for recoil control. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=253s

//Dimensional Hypotrochoid
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Dimensional Hypotrochoid is the first wave frame grenade launcher in the heavy slot, it is stasis based. First column, Envious Assassin seems like a really easy pick given you're probably not gonna be doing most of your killing with this gun, but Stats for All isn't too bad of a pick either, along with Field Prep, even Unrelenting isn't the worst thing here, you have a lot of options, but I'm personally gonna take Envious Assassin. Second column, we have Chain Reaction, a big favorite and a good perk, One for All and... that's really about it for me, I'm not a huge fan of Vorpal anymore now that it's only 10% on bosses for power weapons. I dunno if I'm the hugest fan of this gun just yet in general though, I feel like special waveframe GLs are kinda getting the job done. Blast Radius is good for your minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=297s

// Synchronic Roulette
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Synchronic Roulette. This is a Strand SMG, 600 RPM, so slower firing and wouldn't you know it, it too has Hatchling as a perk and I'm pretty sure that is the overwhelming favorite right now. In the first column, we have some decent options, Envious Assassin, Keep Away, Pulse Monitor, I might skew towards Pulse Monitor or Under Pressure. Again, Envious on a primary I'm not completely sold on, but it's not like it's a BAD option or anything like that. This might be more of a "pick what you like," kind of option, except for Slickdraw, don't pick that. Pugilist in the second column is also somewhat of an option for those of you with Strand builds as they can to be pretty melee focused. We're looking for range in our minor perks, little Arrowhead Brake again and either range or stability depending on your preference. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=353s

// Basso Ostinato
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Basso Ostinato, a void shotgun, 140 RPM, rapid fire. Shotguns in PvE world are a bit weird, not really super popular at the moment, but I feel like with the difficulty increases, they're going to be a better mid-tier difficulty weapon class, stuff that's around -10, -15. In any case, This gun has 3 premier perks in the second column, One Two Punch, Trench Barrel, and new with Lightfall, Destabilizing Rounds, where final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile. Anything with the word Volatile immediately is gonna perk some ears up and this is definitely the most popular perk on this gun at the moment for you void enjoyers out there. That being said, after running with this gun and this perk for a little bit, I wasn't exactly the most impressive, but I also wasn't optimized for its use pretty much at all, so there's probably some more investigating to be done. However, I'm skeptical. In the first column, Envious Assassin isn't a bad choice at all, Lead from Gold also getting a lot of love here, although I dunno if it's my favorite. Don't sleep on Grave Robber either, you're gonna be in melee range with this thing anyway so might as well get some free reloads. I think One-Two Punch is probably better on a harder hitting shotty, the faster ones feel like a more trigger happy kinda gun. You can certainly make arguments for both rapid fire and high impact shotguns in terms of 1-2 Punch viability. I think most people are gonna hunt Destabilizing Rounds to try them out while the perk is still new though, but if it ends up not being good, then 1-2 Punch or Trench Barrel. Magazine perks and range are good for your minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=412s

// Circular Logic
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Circular Logic, a strand machine gun, 450 RPM, which is pretty good. Why don't you take a guess as to what the most popular perk is here? If you said Hatchling, you'd be right. People wanting to experiment with Threadlings and consider how quickly you'll be able to mow down targets with a machine gun, I totally get the appeal. Fortunately the perks in the first column make things pretty simple: Feeding Frenzy, Envious Assassin and Keep Away are all good choices, but I'm probably leaning towards Feeding Frenzy or Envious Assassin. I'd say FF because I'm imagining the way that I would use this gun, which is basically as a primary weapon thanks to the reserves buff that machine guns got, and thus would never get to proc Envious Assassin in the first place. Target Lock is technically also an option thanks to the origin trait on these guns, but this perk turns the gun into more of a single target boss damage weapon vs. an add clear weapon. Interesting idea if you're looking for something to fit that niche. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=525s

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds.

Kill clip is the easiest to use and helps make the second kill easier as you won’t need as many critical hits. Headseeker is my pick for overall neutral play.

You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW.

If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it.

Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW.

// Retrofit Escapade

If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

Having 14 zoom makes it firmly middle of the pack and having the lowest base range in its class (technically Escape Velocity is lower, but Escape Velocity also gets sights, not barrels) doesn’t help it. What it lacks in range it does make up for in stability, being on the upper percentile. It also has some of the best aim assist for its archetype. Rangefinder is definitely a must, as is pushing up the range. Hammer-forged rifling or smallbore is going to be key, but don’t decrease other stats just to increase your range."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X will still have some incredible usefulness in PvP as well. Tunnel vision and kill clip are perfect with one another. At base you have an incredible pulse that can two burst. With kill clip it makes that two burst more forgiving but you also have tunnel vision for more aim assist. With the recent change to kill clip and tunnel vision, both can be refreshed so it keeps both perks active whenever you get a kill." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Gunnora’s Axe
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "With the current state of slug shotguns, you do want to go for as much range as possible while maintaining as high of handling as possible. Fluted barrel or hammer-forged rifling are your best options for barrels. Accurized is the only choice as for whatever reason Gunnora’s Axe doesn’t get access to assault mag. Threat detector and opening shot are the S tier combo to get. Iron reach and moving target are decent substitutes as long as you have the handling to back it up."

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front’s poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2814093983&perks=1820235745,4104185692

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Cold Front has a giant hill to climb and with a lot of competition it might not be worth it. [...] Cold Front does have the best sights IMO so for me it’s semi-worth. In PvP you’re really looking for consistency or lethality. Cold Front does not have super strong lethality perks like kill clip or multikill clip, so you’re looking for consistency. Cold Front does offer rangefinder, putting it on par with its siblings, but the lack of stats still leaves a lot to be desired." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Its base stats aren’t anything to write home about. [...] Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you’re in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=2812100428&perks=124408337,2726471870

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Over in the crucible 450 pulses just aren’t anything important. Messenger exists, and the new hotness is Disparity. Stay Frosty has a lot to build up in order to compete. Arrowhead brake is a must, but smallbore is a decent alternative if you’re fine with the lower recoil direction. Ricochet rounds brings up the stability and bumps up the range a smidge. Over on MnK I would recommend killing wind for the bump in range, handling and movement speed. Couple that with desperado and you’ve got a pretty solid roll for going on sprees." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP it’s all about stacking as many consistency perks as possible. Lowering the charge time via accelerated coils and charge time MW so you won’t have to pre-charge as long. Arrowhead to make tracking easier. Under pressure for the most accuracy bonuses. High-impact reserves for some damage bonuses. It’s not going to be as quick as Midha’s Reckoning but it can get close and feel just as strong." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am always both happy and sad when this weapon rolls around. Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It’s a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75. With these many bullets you should definitely be the coolest person in your fireteam when you hit the cap on damage and be able to show off that sweet, sweet DEEPS." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller
dimwishlist:item=495940989&perks=3300816228,365154968

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Adaptive machine guns have always been my favorite for PvP. Being able to have decent damage at range, good chip damage, and a pretty manageable recoil are all great things to have. Avalanche does bring some good things to the table, like maxing out recoil direction with arrowhead brake. Ricochet rounds gives you some much needed stability. Dynamic sway reduction will reduce your bloom on extended gunfights. On MnK I would recommend swashbuckler or adrenaline junkie for a flat damage bonus." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Zephyr
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It just looks cool. Besides the general Stasis sword go ColdSteel (brrrrrrrr) I would also recommend another roll. Unrelenting to get your health back and chain reaction for STASIS BOOM." Recommended MW - Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

To maximise damage against shields, look for Armor-Piercing Rounds and, in the absence of a complementary column 1 trait, Thresh provides a nice little boost to super regeneration.

title:WarlockMaggie's Season 19, Dawning Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Similar to my PvP recommendation, stability needs to be your priority but you can mix in range to get a bit more accuracy. Steady Rounds plus a Range MW provides that mix with a little extra Airborne Effectiveness to help you get the jump on your opponents. Combine that with a tried and true consistency combo of Tap the Trigger and Rangefinder, this will work for you if you put in the work of finding this roll. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Encore got a rework this season and it works well with Desperado as any missed precision final blows will still increase the range, stability and accuracy of the weapon (5, 8, and 1.25% / stack, up to 4 stacks). With the classic combo of Arrowhead Brake and Ricochet Rounds, Stay Frosty will perform. Another possible fourth column perk would be Headseeker as it also got a rework that increases damage and aim assist. Either way, the lightweight frame will additionally give you a little boost in movement speed which may help you take cover from that Chaos Reach that just showed up.

Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Adaptives are my favorite LMG archetype and this extends to use within Crucible. With a requirement of 5 crits to achieve the coveted .53s TTK, accuracy is going to be vital: enter DSR + Tap the Trigger. With DSR taking 0.6 seconds to fully ramp up, you will likely be near maximum benefit by that 5th shot.

Couple it with Duelist’s Trance for extra stats. It’s a chilling prospect to consider… Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Okay, hear me out on this combo. It’s a unique one to the Adaptive frame sword archetype and what it allows is the ability to steal the overshield of a supering Guardian and apply it to yourself while dealing increased damage. This could mean you can easily shut down roaming, ground-based supers and survive the opposing team’s retribution. Otherwise, it’s just like any other sword in the Crucible (that doesn’t have Eager Edge). Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

title:SirStallion's Season 19, Dawning Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Smallbore and Flared are both going to provide minor buffs to stability which will be felt massively on a gun with a base of 7. Plus a little extra reload to help Frenzy along is never a bad thing, so Flared is a no brainer for me. Frenzy is fairly obvious, damage boost + reload boost baked into the same perk is really nice. Unrelenting may not be everyone's first pick, but for me, this gun feels like a mobbing monster, getting healing inside that same role is just a cherry on top. MW Unimportant|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): While the main traits are obvious picks as far as this weapon is concerned, the rest is a little confusing. With a base 7 stability, will full sending into the stat actually make a meaningful difference? Will losing it entirely via Full Bore make a difference? I honestly don't know. I will be looking for these rolls because they're a great middle ground with a little extra stability for controllers. I do believe the rolls are interchangeable though, since it's just a MW difference. Recommended MW: Range (M+KB), Stability (Controller)|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): Lightweight pulses are feeling a lot better in PvP these days and for me, Killing Wind and Kill Clip are perks that perfectly compliment each other and provide so many benefits to the gun it becomes a no brainer. With 55 Recoil Direction, Arrowhead Brake is a must on Stay Frosty and High-Caliber should assist in opening duels to get KW/KC rolling. Omolon Fluid Dynamics will make up for any stability or reload speed losses meaning you can get the extra little bit of range from the MW. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This roll feels fairly obvious. Kill stuff, Res Burst explodes them, Subsistence fills your mag and Res Burst is ready again. It's just good fun times and I didnt get it last year. The bonus damage from Res Burst will make up for the loss of impact from the Accelerated Coils and Charge Time MW.

// Glacioclasm
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): This weapon is a High-Impact. You can try to skirt that fact with lower charge times, but it will still charge slow and hit hard as long as you're accurate. I say embrace it and full send into consistency. Corrected recoil direction, higher stability, better accuracy while under fire. Which you inevitably will be with a High-Impact. Unlike PvE, I don't feel the attempt at lowering charge time is worth it. Recommended MW: Stability|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

// Avalanche
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB): As a 450, Avalanche falls into a very controllable category in PvP which means you can fairly comfortably commit to more range for short bursts of damage (like the time it might take to drop a guardian) instead of long term consistent shots. So, range range range. A little extra stability for the controller players and once you get a kill and trigger Encore, all subsequent kills should be a lot easier to manage. DSR is also an option, but only if going for multi-kills, in my opinion. If the kills are a little more spread out, I'd rather have Encore. Recommended MW: Range|tags:pvp,mkb

// Zephyr
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This one is tricky. I wanted to look for Thresh and Chain Reaction, but Half Truths can get that same roll and it would be enhanced via crafting. So it's necessary to commit to the thing only this sword can do, and that's Cold Steel. I figured Cold Steel and Wellspring would be a nice combo for any hyper aggressive Stasis builds. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvP / M+KB / Controller): I got nothing. I personally would never take this sword into PvP, but if I absolutely had to I'd likely end up using my heavy to fight supers, which would never result in me escaping unscathed so unrelenting might help? Maybe? In any case, Cold Steel is doing nothing for you in PvP, which is the only thing that makes this sword unique. Recommended MW: Impact|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look to boost Handling with the barrel. You want to go all in to the magazine size, so use Extended Barrel and Backup Mag to get to five in the mag. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by up to three on reload, and in the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles or High-Impact Reserves will add up to 25% bonus damage once you get past the second bullet. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Boss or Taken Spec) mod.

Typically, I aim for strong stability, and ways to force a reload to make LMGs viable, as no one wants to spend 5 full seconds reloading mid-combat. Planck's doesn't really have that outside of Grave Robber, which means using an LMG for CQC engagements to get the most out of its perk pool. I can see it working with ranged melees, like with Warlock's Celestial Fire - a synergistic Karnstein, Grave Robber / Pugilist build could be fun. Ultimately, there's a few interesting options here for build-crafters, but not a lot to help it win out against better LMGs." tags:pve|tags:pve

It kicks, 50RD is inconsistent at best, and sabotaging your play at worst. But -- if you get Heating Up, it completely fixes this, and allows you to make use of the utterly fantastic fourth column perks without reprieve.

// Smite of Merain (Harrowed) - [YeezyGT's S18] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Smite of Merain is a great-feeling Pulse with a stellar perk pool. For PvE, you're looking for consistent damage uptime, high Handling (always important for Champion content), and ways to bolster your abilities. Smite does all of this quite well. I'd be looking at Demo/Gutshot for high-level (Vorpal if Anti-Barrier Pulse is a thing), Demo/Adrenaline for low-level content, and Firefly just for the fun factor. Stats for All / One for All IS good, I just tend not to recommend it on Primary weapons that typically deal with one target at a time, unlike Heavies sporting the ability to really snowball kills." tags:pve|tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Charge] "Stormchaser still reigns as one of the best-in-slot options, currently being the only burst-fire frame, and making up DPS potential with fast reload options such as Rapid Hit/Frenzy. There's a roll for everyone - Auto-Loading Holster, Clown Cartridge, Firing Line, Frenzy/Vorpal for solo activities - all sorts. It's well-loved, and well-loved for a reason." tags:god-pve|tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Roar of the Bear does something many other Rockets can't. Combining Auto-Loading Holster with Demolitionist gives it great utility, and making it a dual-purpose Rocket for swapping with weapons like Izanagi's Burden. Impulse Amplifier / Auto-Loading Holster with high Handling makes this a top contender for Divinity users too, as you can maintain the Divinity cage while shooting off Rockets of your own." tags:pve|tags:pve

// BrayTech Werewolf (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Tap the Trigger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s (4c, 4b) as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For duelling, you don't really need to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger which together add stability and accuracy through your volley. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot), and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s (7c, 3b) which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s (7c, 1b) and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s (5c, 4b). If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s (6c) or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s (4c, 3b). Recommended MW: Stability, with a Counterbalance mod.|tags: PvP, PvP-KillChain, PvP-God, MKB, Controller

For snipers you generally want to boost Handling with the barrel. In the mag, there's not an awful lot to help out, but Alloy Mag is probably your best pick to help with reloads after you've emptied the mag.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. The Lightweight frame suits aggressive, mobile playstyles, boosting sprint speed by 6.25% and passively adding 20 mobility to help close gaps quickly - you'll need to hit 11 out of 12 pellets for a kill at any resilience. Good all-round stats within the subfamily. For Lightweights, range needs to be over 80 to give a 6.28m range - aim to get to 55 with your barrel, mag and masterwork, without hurting handling or projectile spread. Then Slideshot will add 20, and Opening Shot another 25 to get to 100, which pushes the range out to 7m. Just remember to ABS (always be sliding), and always follow up with a melee!

@title:Season 19 Deep Stone Crypt raid weapons
@description:Reprised DSC Raid weapons with the Bray Inheritance origin perk

// Posterity (PvE first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Voltshot, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for arc synergy and end-game content. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Who would have thought that the hottest property from DSC would be a precision hand cannon? Stats are good by comparison with competitors. Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and Tactical Mag adds couple of extra bullets and stability. Unusually, Voltshot rolls in the first trait column and is the runaway best option for add clear, and using Frenzy as a second damage perk also boosts handling and reload to 100 so you can proc Voltshot's jolt as fast as possible after a kill, which will also stun Overload champions from Lightfall (Season 20) onwards. Just chef's kiss good. Recommended MW: Range, with a Minor or Taken Spec mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-Champion, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Precision HCs aren't the best choice for PvE as at v6.3.0.7, but just in case they ever get at little love, this might be worth tucking away. Stats are good by comparison with competitors. Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and Tactical Mag adds couple of extra bullets and stability. For end-game add clear, Reconstruction can double the size of your magazine, or Rapid Hit or Surplus and Frenzy between them can passively max out stability, handling and reload speed and add 15% damage.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and end-game content. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag). Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion layers more stability and reload speed - stability is good to help stay on a crit spot. Incandescent is great for add clear and hits your solar verbs.

The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag). For melee builds, Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the natural choice - get a melee kill for a refreshable 33% damage boost, and then each hit regenerates a little melee energy from the origin trait, while each kill regenerates a full 10%.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod). If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage.

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s (12s with the Enhanced Perk) for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury.

title:King's Fall Raid PvP weapon picks with illPhysics
description:Reprised King's Fall weapons with Runneth Over origin trait

// Doom of Chelchis (PvP first-choice roll)
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable.  First-choice PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload (at 180 RPM) and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight.

// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable. Backup PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload (at 180 RPM) and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Radar Tuner (to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping), Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-Duel, MKB, Controller

With Gutshot Straight and Focussed Fury, if you can get to the maximum mag size of 14, and can hit 7 crits without reloading (not as easy with the Aim Assist penalty), then you can 3-body shot kill any resilience - your seven remaining shots should provide two very easy kills.

// Midha's Reckoning (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore), (Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils), Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics (and thanks to @Legoleflash). First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 278 with @Critbuff. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. As with all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork. You have access to the best PvP Origin Perk in Suros Synergy in a solid Pulse Rifle subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.93s with the first bullet of a third burst (6 crits, 1 body), to a 0.6s six crit kill. Stats are on the low side, including a truly terrible Recoil Direction of 50, so you will need a Counterbalance mod even with Arrowhead Brake, but you'll also benefit from its reduction of 30 bounce intensity, so it's still the best barrel park.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Drops from Vanguard activities, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. Maybe not meta as at S18 v6.2.0.6, but Aggressive Frame HCs are always handy for bounties or patrols that call for crit kills, anyway. Good stats overall, slow firing, so stability is less important - add Handling with Fluted Barrel and add a few extra bullets with Appended Mag.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE backup roll for general content, particularly for solar subclasses. Shapeable. Good stats by comparison with other energy Precision frame ARs. Focus on Handling or Stability in the barrel, as with the Precision Frame you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction,  and virtually any other magazine (except perhaps Alloy Mag or Extended Mag) will work fine. For solar subclasses using Incandescent for scorch and ignite and Triple Tap or Ambitious Assassin will make the most of the magazine.

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB PvP) Recommended MW: Range “In PvP you can go one or two ways max range, or not quite max range. With rangefinder in the third column you can really opt for anything within that final column and be okay. Eye of the storm is a perfect pairing because you will definitely be taking damage to get into sidearm range to begin with. Multikill clip gives you that slaying potential. If you wanted to invest fully into range you can do so and you will hit 18.95m, but I would suggest going to hammer-forged, losing that extra meter and dropping to 17.96 so you will not lose any stats. 18.95 m (max), 17.96 without losing stats“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, M+KB

// Ammit AR2
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Ammit AR2 is a fantastic feeling auto rifle, held back by the fact it is an auto rifle. Arrowhead brake is almost a must to max out that recoil direction. Incandescent is a fantastic perk on autos as you do not always get that crit for dragonfly when you are spraying thrall or dregs (sorry Misraackskell). I would also recommend going with ambitious assassin on everything just because it got a buff.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Auto Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Blood Feud
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Blood Feud looks to be the best weapon from Plunder activities. Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play. Just make sure to have some stability so you will not be looking at Io (RIP Asher).“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Blood Feud
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB PvP) Recommended MW: Range “In PvP I do not think Blood Feud will replace other smgs, namely Huckleberry. You can get some interesting Stasis synergy with headstone, but Forensic Nightmare exists. Whether you prefer a 600 to a 750 is personal preference. I think elemental capacitor on either stasis, arc, or void is going to be one of the best feeling submachine guns to shoot.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, M+KB

// Boudica-c
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “This is a fun little piece. Boudica-C is in the precision frame, meaning the slowest firing but hardest hitting sidearm archetype. it is a fine line between an overpowered sidearm and an underpowered hand cannon. This bridges the gap nicely while still feeling like a good sidearm. Again, I have to let you know sidearms are not meta, nor are they the best choice for middle to high-tier content. But they are damn fun and you should use what you like.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB PvP) Recommended MW: Range “In PvP this archetype feels good when it works, but when it does not you feel like you are fighting the gun more than the newest hunter build. Swashbuckler will give you an incredibly forgiving time to kill, paired with moving target for the passive aim assist and strafe speed. If sidearm airborne effectiveness was fine enough to exist without major increases to feel good, I would wholeheartedly recommend at least trying this sidearm in PvP, until then vault it for a rainy day.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, M+KB

// Brigand's Law
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I love me some 450 sidearms, they are goofy and fun. Brigand's Law is no exception to that rule. With surrounded and feeding frenzy or threat detector you will be right up in the mix of things and getting that nice damage off. Definitely take this into a GM and let me know how it handles.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Scout Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time.

For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference.

// The Militia's Birthright (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I am so very glad Militia's Birthright is back. Mostly for my friend u/The_SpellJammer. Militia's Birthright has not really seen too many changes from its former self. Ambitious and auto-loading are funny together, but unfortunately do not proc one another. Lead from gold is another fantastic perk when paired with a full lead from gold build. Frenzy is the top choice for the final column. Having two grenades with the 15% damage increase, 50 handling, and the most important part being the 50 reload. The reload alone will max out your reload stat making it easier to reload into ambitious assassin.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Grenade Launcher Special Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB PvP) Recommended MW: Range “PvP is a slightly different story. You still want arrowhead brake and counterbalance to make this weapon feel smooth. Ricochet rounds are going to give you the best flinch resistance and stats. Perpetual motion will bring up the remaining stats the rest of the way, and rampage will allow you to two burst after a kill. If you want more of a dueling pulse you can opt for eye of the storm. Desperado makes an appearance on a different frame, but I do not see that as being the best choice for a lot of players as it makes the gun feel like two different weapons before or after a kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvP, M+KB

A quick warning. the intrinsic trait will make reload-based perks (like MKC and Tunnel Vision) near useless in team activities. For magazine options, choose getting more shots or increasing Stability/Reload, either or both will help combat common Aggressive frame issues.

title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Tarnished Mettle (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Steady Rounds, Moving Target, (Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness (if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!). The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.  Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Sprint Grip, Quick Access Sling, Freehand Grip (or Icarus Grip if you're serious about aerial use) mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Elemental Capacitor
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for duelling, to tuck away just in case, you might as well add to range with barrel and mag, and then make it more controllable with Dynamic Sway Reduction and Elemental Capacitor with a Void subclass. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference.|tags: PvP, PvP-God, PvP-Duel, Controller, MKB
dimwishlist:item=1509167284&perks=1359896290,3511092054

// Blood Feud (PvP first-choice roll)
// Polygonal Rifling, Steady Rounds, Pugilist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent (also proccing the origin trait) to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

// Brigand's Law (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Accurized Rounds, (Hip-Fire Grip, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion), (Swashbuckler, Surrounded)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

// No Reprieve (PvP first-choice roll)
// (Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Accurized Rounds, Pugilist, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Excellent first-choice slug-shottie, particularly for Stasis subclasses who can use an Aspect to create Stasis shards, and Fragments to use those to regain melee and grenade energy or for Damage Reduction. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first trait column, and  Headstone gives you all the stasis good stuff in the second and, as a bonus in Comp or Trials, prevents revives while the crystal persists.

// (Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling), Light Mag, Pugilist, (Swashbuckler, Surrounded)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Backup choice for a slug-shottie, and the perks can make this into a kill-chaining monster if you can find the ammo. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first train column, and then a fully-procced Swashbuckler or Enhanced Surrounded (when Bungie rolls the boost from the mod into the perk) in the second column brings the damage up to one-shot body levels. Recommended MW: Range, with a Freehand Grip or Targeting Adjustor mod.|tags: PvP, PvP-Chain, Controller, MKB

// Midha's Reckoning (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), (Ionised Battery, Enhanced Battery), Field Prep, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Any Battery with Backup Mag pushes you up to eight shots in the battery, so why not take advantage of a shorter charge time from Accelerated Coils? Further build into the faster charge time with Cornered, add ammo reserves and faster reloads with Field Prep, or trigger health regeneration on kills with Unrelenting in the first trait column. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. Reservoir Burst procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, giving you a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

To clear majors, choose a barrel that adds a little to range and/or handling, Tactical Mag for an extra bullet in the magazine or Assault Mag if you miss a pellet. Then, Pugilist and the Hot Swap origin perk help boost handling, while lightweights still fire fast enough to take advantage of the 50% damage buff from Trench Barrel. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with a damage boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Endgame, Controller, MKB

// Pardon Our Dust (PvE backup roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Blinding Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, (Demolitionist, Pugilist)
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox. Unfortunately, Danger Zone has been lost in its re-issued format, so there's no complementary trait in the last column. You'll be swapping back and forth, so go for a handling barrel. Obviously Blinding Grenades in the mag, and then Auto-Loading Holster to reload while you're mopping up your blinded enemies with your Energy weapon. As there's not that much in the second column of traits, but if you do manage to catch an add or two, you might as well try to get some ability energy out of it. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Quick Access Sling mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-God, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-Endgame, Controller, MKB

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE first-choice roll for general content. If you haven't got a kinetic grenade launcher for dealing with adds, this offers some good options. Use your barrel to increase projectile speed without harming Blast Radius, and then High-Velocity Rounds adds Velocity and Reload Speed. Both Auto-Loading Holster and Ambitious Assassin have their place, and then a trait in the last column  to add handling and melee energy.

// Lingering Dread
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Chill clip on a tube grenade launcher? Heck yeah. Sign me up. Now that blinding grenades and concussion grenades caught another nerf, any crowd control is good crowd control. Spike grenades will see a small rise in popularity with Lingering Dread as you do need direct impacts to apply the slow effect. Auto-loading holster or ambitious assassin are both incredible for two different play styles, but a sleeper perk is unrelenting. You can easily get multikills with grenade launchers, and the added health regeneration is noticeable" Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lingering Dread
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvP you could try for chill clip but I think the utility of demolitionist for potentially shooting twice in quick succession is better. You’ll also need to have good aim to get those direct hits. Whereas with demolitionist if you do happen to get a kill with Lingering Dread you’ll just get some of your grenade cooldown knocked off. Proximity grenades are the best in slot for demoltionist, but if you wanted the alternative high-velocity rounds for getting the grenade to targets with chill clip is the way to go."

// New Purpose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "New Purpose fills a different niche compared to Messenger. Neither are stronger than the other. New Purpose has headstone, vorpal weapon, and feeding frenzy. Messenger has rapid hit and adept mods. I think the strength of New Purpose is its synergy with stasis as well as the addition of feeding frenzy and vorpal weapon. Both have the stopping power of buffed desperado, but having vorpal for majors and champs is a bonus in New Purpose’s corner." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// New Purpose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of PvP it’s really close. Rapid hit and the adept mods to give a small edge to messenger, but needing only arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and have a perfectly vertical recoil direction is really hard to pass up. It completely frees up your mod slot for radar tuner, targeting, or whatever else tickles your fancy." Recommended MW - Range (M+KB) or Stability (Controller).|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

While it doesn’t have the best PvE applications it is still a great option" Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Epicurean
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Rangefinder is the absolute best in slot perk for the Epicurean. Zoom is the most important thing on fusion rifles. While Main Ingredient still boasts the best in class zoom, the Epicurean can come pretty close. Snapshot sights or surplus will make the Epicurean feel lighter or handle better which is one of its lowest stats. Look for arrowhead brake to clean up the recoil and make those longer ranged voops easier to handle." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Unforgiven
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Unforgiven in PvP is a bit of a mixed bag. Aggressive frame submachine guns aren’t exactly the easiest to use on controllers, but MnK can really leverage its strengths. For both input methods, maxing out the recoil direction at 100 with either chambered compensator or extended barrel will be the first play. A good combination for grenade centered builds will be demolitionist and adrenaline junkie, but if you happen to find yourself on a more neutral void subclass then you might like golden tricorn. You probably won’t see golden tricorn 2x too often, but when you do and the stars align you’ll have a monster in your hands." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

// Fixed Odds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): " the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps."

// Fixed Odds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "High-Impact machine guns in PvP are not the first choice, and really not even the second or third choice either. Their TtK is competitive, but their forgiveness and ease of use is not. Arrowhead brake really cleans up the recoil and will make follow up shots a lot easier to hit. Pair that with accurized rounds to extend your engagement range. Finally, because of the nature of heavy ammo in PvP, you’ll be happy to grab a roll with under pressure for the added accuracy and stability. Best of luck to anyone who uses this."

// Stormchaser
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A three round burst linear fusion. It’s most similar to high-impact fusions, but it does significantly more damage and charges faster. For PvE auto-loading holster, clown cartridge, or rapid hit are all fantastic options. Firing line, frenzy, and vorpal are all really close in terms of best in slot, but I would rank them in that order. Firing line is the easiest to proc, frenzy can be your whole loadout, and vorpal while the weakest is still 10% damage. Depending on how you decide to play will determine which is best for you."

// Stormchaser
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "I think Stormchaser is a weird weapon for the crucible. It does do enough to body shot with the whole burst, but you’re better off going for a crit with just a regular linear fusion rifle or body shot with adagio. Stormchaser is cool and I think it will see some use, but I don’t think it will be anyone’s first pick." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pvp,mkb,controller

// Chain of Command
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The unique factor is Osmosis to change its damage type from stasis to whatever subclass you happen to be on. A real jack of all trades. Unfortunately it is the true master of one. Having both adrenaline junkie and demolitionist really elevate it with grenade builds on Void 3.0 or some Solar 3.0 builds, but I would rather have either a dedicated “big-deeps” machine gun or an add clear machine gun with firefly or dragonfly. I don’t really find myself using machine guns for add clearing, but having a very reliable weapon for grenade builds is never a bad option. I think it would pair best with Void 3.0 and lead from gold builds." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Similar to Season of the Cartesian Coordinate vorpal weapon is the best in slot perk to chase after. With 12 perks in that column you’ll just have to pray to RNGesus to even see the perk. The two very close second and third are chill clip for Stasis oriented builds (or general add control builds), and frenzy for neutral damage across all enemy types.

// Dead Weight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "Rapid-fire shotguns do not fare so well in PvP compared to PvE. Full choke is still mandatory to secure the best possibility for a two-tap kill. Accurized rounds pushes out the fall off so you’d still be able to do that solid 1 damage at 3m and beyond. Perpetual motion brings up the already healthy handling. Where Dead Weight falls off hard is in the final column.

Strident Whistle would need to have the lowest charge time of 576 to even compete in PvP. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy back up after elastic string lowers it. Archer’s tempo is still great here, as is explosive head for double flinch. Moving target is a great pick if you feel you use your bow for follow up shots instead of bow-swap.

The two most important factors for deep OHK on a fusion are zoom followed by stability. Because the Wizened Rebuke cannot roll rangefinder, the next best thing is to invest into stability to make sure that all the bolts hit.

From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "it shipped super underwhelming. DFA has a lot of competition in its slot. From the hugely popular Fatebringer to the fan favorite Dire Promise, from the OG Eyasluna to OG Austringer. Not even including the exotic kinetic hand cannons, DFA has a high hill to climb. The benefit DFA has over some of the other weapons is the possibility of getting adept rolls for the bonus masterworks and adept mods. This doesn’t entirely cover the fact that DFA’s perk pool just shipped underwhelming. Outlaw and rampage are tried and true but extremely boring. Vorpal weapon is great and makes DFA the first kinetic 140 with vorpal, but that alone doesn’t bring it up past some of the aforementioned powerhouses."

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB): "Where I’ve heard the most chatter around Enyo-D is in the Crucible. People are calling it the Antiope-D 2.0 or the kinetic Shayura’s Wrath. I think both are true, but the Enyo-D still has some shortcomings when it comes to comparing against the both. Enyo-D does not have kill clip. Multikill clip is fine and good, but the immediate 33% damage bonus is incredible on any precision frame smg. Enyo-D also has less zoom than both. The zoom field has been condensed, but the 16 zoom smgs will still be some of the best out of the gate. Steady hands also brings up one of Enyo-D’s weakest stats and makes it feel incredibly fluid. Keep an eye out for this one." Recommended MW - Range.|tags:pvp,mkb

Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect.

Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on.

// originally from https://github.com/Adamsdown-Boy/destiny-rolls/blob/main/player-versus-enemies-rolls/ep18-reprised-opulent-weapons.txt

// Austringer (PvE first choice roll)
// Corkscrew Rifling, (Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell), (Outlaw Enhanced, Outlaw), (Frenzy Enhanced, Frenzy)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 18. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. To Excess origin perk is most useful with Tier 4/5 supers with the shortest cooldown, but can add to melee/grenade builds. Perk pool is more PvP orientated - there are better 140 Hands Cannons. But if you do want to craft one, Corkscrew Rifling gives a mix of boosts, choose your combat perk of choice in the mag, and then Outlaw and Frenzy are the best of the traits. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Backup Mag mod or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.|tags:pve

In the same slot as Duty Bound or Scathelocke, which both have better Zoom, so you might need a touch of either range or stability, depending on preference, to compensate. Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up the wonky recoil and one of the Combat Effect magazines adds a little range and some utility effect. For end-game content, Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie is a natural pairing, for grenade-based builds. Drops from the second (Hexahedron Room) encounter if you're looking to farm it.

Rapid Hit crit hits will play well with the Omolon origin trail, to add stability as the magazine empties, and Opening Shot gives you a great blinting HC.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Shapeable.

You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping.

Arrowhead brake is still the best barrel, and I would recommend a counterbalance mod to get that recoil to 100 and give you the ease of use to invest into range or more consistency perks. The “big” damage perks on Sweet Sorrow don’t lend themselves to the PvP landscape, but one could argue demolitionist is a lethality perk, especially with current Void 3.0 grenades.

Le Monarche just got a wonderful catalyst in unrelenting, so you could potentially have a legendary lemon through dragonfly and unrelenting together.

You can fully send into handling and stability to offset the lower base stats, but you can’t go half way with it.

// Reckless Endangerment
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvE there are just better shotguns, where a neutral, high-handling weapon just will not fit the bill. In Reckless Endangerment’s benefit is how smooth it feels to use. No other shotgun really comes close to how fluid this feels without any investment. [...] Crucible is where Reckless Endangerment can really flex [...] Having a shotgun that you don’t really have to invest in to make it feel fluid gives new players and people uncomfortable with PvP a shotgun to compete with. The obvious comparison is Riiswalker and I do think Riiswalker takes the cake over Reckless Endangerment in all forms of PvP.

// Palmyra-B
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In terms of PvP the tracking is a nice feature but I wouldn’t count on it 100% of the time.

That being said, it doesn’t immediately make them good, nor does it make them bad. Most people have shifted towards higher zooms, namely 45 and 50 zooms. The two things that can bump up Father’s Sins in my book is the ease of getting one and crafting it to your liking, as well as having access to under pressure and opening shot. With a higher base aim assist than the likes of Occluded Finality and Shephard’s Watch it could see some use being the bullet bending sniper.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Arctic Haze is heavily, heavily slept on. With Overload ARs (and a rework) looming, a 20% Vorpal buff for primaries, some great perk options, easy farming options, and 720s generally shredding for CQC, I can foresee Arctic Haze being very viable (or at the least, very fun). Dragonfly is fun. Unrelenting is amazing in PvE now. The Recoil Direction naturally sucks, but it had to be reigned in somewhere." tags:pve

The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

// Retraced Path - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "A new meme beam. You'll find this actually out-performing Prometheus Lens when paired with Subsistence/Frenzy. You can do some decent numbers with One for All given the easy activation requirements for a weapon of this type, and Golden Tricorn is a pretty huge damage buff if that matches your playstyle. I really think Subsistence transforms this gun in a way that makes it necessary, though I'll include Perpetual here for the steady Reload + Stability buffs. Try hip-firing for a very Halo-esque experience." tags:pve

// Bottom Dollar - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range / Stability] "Bottom Dollar's fallen from grace somewhat, but 120RPMs are still incredibly viable in the right hands. It's incredibly, incredibly unlikely you'll ever pin down a personal 5/5 roll (due to there being 12 potential perks... in each column), so I'd recommend going to town with one that ticks a few boxes for you and seeing if you can put in work. Explosive Rounds are incredibly strong on harder-hitting weapons, coupling with High-Cal due to the massive flinch they give off allowing you to challenge less-confident Snipers (and occasionally LFRs). The achievable range on Bottom Dollar is crazy, and if it matches your playstyle, you'll do very well with it." tags:pvp

Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu.

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

// Biting Winds - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Draw Time / Reload] "Biting Winds rolls with some great perk combinations, like Rapid Hit/Explosive Head, Killing Wind/Swashbuckler, and even some utility picks like Sympathetic Arsenal. In general, for PvE you likely want to pin down an Explosive Head roll, Elastic String (Polymer or Flexible as 2nd choice), and just invest into getting Draw Time and Reload as far down as you can. It's infinitely more farmable than the (slightly better) Accrued Redemption, if you don't mind having to re-fight Kridis three thousand times." tags:pve

Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights.

Assassin's Blade sets your movement speed to max sprint, which allows chaining kills to become easier, and One-for-All is nice for encounters like Zulmak in Pit of Heresy, or Phalanx Echo, where you can cash in on a 35% damage buff fairly easily." tags:pve

// Shayura's Wrath (Adept) - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Simply incredible. There's some great Kill Clip-synergy perks in Col. 3, namely Heating Up / Tunnel Vision, some ease-of-use options like Dynamic Sway, Hip-Fire Grip, Moving Target, and then some interesting strafe options running Elemental Capacitor/Moving Target simultaneously. Invest heavily in Range and it'll surprise you how far out you can get kills." tags:god-pvp

// Techeun Force - [YeezyGT's S16] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Stability] "Few interesting combos on Techeun Force -- Under Pressure/Rangefinder, Under Pressure/High Impact Reserves, even Charge Time reductions in Backup Plan. In general, keep Stability high, and aim for a lower Charge Time where possible." tags:pvp

// The Third Axiom - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "The Third Axiom is a decent pick. It's difficult to pin down a coherent roll given its 12 perks in each column, but if you get one that makes sense, it's fairly reliable for harder content. I've brought 390RPM Pulses into a few different GMs, and they always do fine. The benefit here being an elemental Pulse if you need one for Match Game - if you're not in need of that, you might find more success with 340RPMs like Messenger, simply for the Range benefits." tags:pve

// 1000 Yard Stare - [YeezyGT's S16] (PvP): (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The PvP player's "1K". Rocking the now-incredibly rare combo of Quickdraw/Snapshot, 1K is one of the most fluid-feeling Snipers in the game. The scope decals may require a small adjustment period, but the benefits of being able to invest primarily in Range (more aim assist at distance) over Handling feel like a great trade-off. This is a familiar-feeling Sniper, a great workhorse, and incredibly easy to farm for. Ticks all the boxes." tags:god-pvp

// Heritage - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Widely regarded as the greatest Legendary slug. There's a lot you can do with Heritage. Moving Target is fantastic on Slugs - +10 Aim Assist is huge. Killing Wind gives you a Diet Chaperone. Hip-Fire Grip is actually really strong here, and I've hit far more hip-fire headshots in the heat of the moment than you'd expect. Keep your Handling as high as possible - the range difference is fairly negligible from 80-100, we're talking about 1 metre of range (literally about 1 step in-game), and Handling is massively important." tags:god-pvp

// The Hothead - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:god-pve

// Reed's Regret (PvE first choice roll)
// Any barrel, Ionized Battery, Triple Tap, Firing Line, Veist Stinger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 10. PvE first choice roll for Boss DPS. Barrel depends on your range/stability/handling preferences.

Now usurping Imperial Needle with the classic Archer's/Explosive Head combo, optional Crafting to fully invest into Draw Time, fantastic alternatives in Hip-Fire Grip, reload boosters in Perpetual Motion, ad clear in Dragonfly, and the true Hawkeye combo of Archer's/Successful Warm Up to mimic the Hush days of old. Fantastic bow. Shades well too." tags:god-pve

// Pointed Inquiry - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Pointed Inquiry's main synergy comes in the form of Genesis + Adaptive Munitions/Turnabout. Shoot to Loot/Dragonfly has nice synergy, though with this 150RPM, I primarily see this as a high-level content, ranged-engagement weapon that you may end up using somewhat sparingly, if at all. Most perks should work here, though I'd rate it pretty low on the Scout Rifle food chain." tags:pve

As a Craftable weapon, you have a number of options, namely being able to fine-tune the stability/handling for consistency, which I've always felt is the real barrier-to-entry for 360RPMs. Perpetual Motion is fantastic as always, Adaptive Munitions can help it become a workhorse for higher-level content, along with One-for-All, or spec into Dragonfly for, well, explosions." tags:pve

Many will flock to Iron Reach for the huge visual Range stat bump, though I would recommend checking the breakdown on D2Gunsmith -- for 18 Range (roughly a 2m difference), you lose 27 Stability, which is very, very noticeable. The trade-off in-game is not as appealing as on paper. That being said, if you're investing heavily in Stability to offset it, it could be very nice to get the incremental range bump." tags:pvp

You have access to Archer's, Perpetual and Killing Wind depending on playstyle, and Explosive/Successful and Adrenaline Junkie. Whereas I believe Whispering Slab's Swashbuckler to be a stronger perk for Bows (with AJ having more grenade synergy on Energy weapons), the damage perk does not go unnoticed.

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Forensic Nightmare feels great, looks great, and has some stellar perk options. It's primary issue, however, lies in its 13 Zoom stat, which effectively castrates the gun. With a (base) max damage falloff of 15m, comparing to Shayura's 17 Zoom, 21.3m damage falloff... It's incredibly noticeable. There's some issues with muzzle flash here in darker areas too. Ultimately, I'd rely on the great perks Forensic has access to, and use it more casually. A shame that the Zoom stat neuters this gun, as even the Friction Fire has 16 for the exact same frame." tags:pve

// Fugue-55 - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling / Range] "Fugue-55 (pronounced 'fyoog') has the normal options, then a couple of interesting ones, like being able to combo Steady Hands / Snapshot, reduced flinch with the Suros Synergy Origin Trait, and then (more PvE-focused), Auto-Loading/Vorpal (which is actually the perfect pairing for the Verity's Brow Atheon build). Not too bad." tags:pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Lubrae's Ruin is amazing. While maybe not a go-to for the higher-end PvE sandbox, it wins out on "cool factor", having wrested Rhulk's weapon that destroyed his home planet. A little cooler is Grave Robber's synergy on Glaives, with the Glaive melee fully reloading the magazine and nullifying any need to invest in reload perks. Swashbuckler currently only boosts the projectile damage, but the projectiles are a larger part of the Glaive identity we haven't fully realised yet. Currently, this is the only Glaive that feels good to me - but its still early days." tags:pve

There's a masterclass of perks here, with access to Perpetual/Surplus/Threat Detector/Pulse Monitor/Steady Hands, then E-Cap/Moving Target/Opening Shot/Frenzy/Vorpal. This is a slug frame I much prefer feel-wise to Heritage, closer to the more traditional gun styles from earlier in the franchise's lifespan.

A PvE Insidious can have a one-of-a-kind (non-sunset) combo in Dragonfly/Rampage, though you're no longer benefitting from something like Rapid Hit / Heating Up, which are usually fixing your reload/recoil direction issues. Vorpal shreds Supers on this archetype, Demo/Adrenaline still rocks, Rapid Hit is perfect for 4-burst Pulses (and you feel the stability change mid-burst too) - there's a lot to love here, you've just gotta get the stars to align." tags:pve

Auto-Loading Holster with Explosive Light is going to be your go-to for all your damage needs, unless for some reason you want to shoot all rockets consecutively, then you're after Impulse/Frenzy or Impulse/Explosive Light depending on orb usage (but likely another rocket altogether that actually rolls with Clown Cartridge).

With Enhanced Overflow, Extended Mag and Backup Mag, it maxes out at 17(!) in the mag, when paired with Font of Might, goes toe-to-toe with Izanagi's Burden. It's a bit more difficult to optimise swaps, but frees up the Exotic slot. Firing Line is the obvious option, though Focused Fury has a pretty low activation requirement, and allows you to use it solo / separate from teammates. That should come down to personal preference." tags:god-pve

Land Tank is a great Origin perk to have, especially for a wave frame where you are getting rapid kills in close proximity to the enemy. Unrelenting pairs naturally here, along with fast reloader perks like Threat Detector / Feeding Frenzy / Frenzy.

Firmly Planted (of course), Surplus as a reload booster, Heating Up for kill chaining, and the Omolon Origin trait that pairs fantastically with Reservoir Burst. Outside of that niche, Frenzy, HIRs and Successful Warm Up are all stellar options. Invest in the usual Fusion specs and Snorri should become a great workhorse for you." tags:pve

That unfortunately results in the loss of Full Choke / Assault Mag options, if you want to get the full bang-for-your-buck in the OHK department.

title:Season 15 Vanguard Nightfall weapons
notes:Reprised D1 weapons dropping from Nightfall completions

// Hung Jury SR4 (PvE first choice roll)
// (Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), Extended Barrel, Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload 
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 2. PvE first choice roll for end game content. Rapid Hit more than offsets the Extended Barrel reload penalty, and Explosive Payload adds flinch and better anti-Overload Champion performance when that mod's in town. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Stability, with Backup Mag or damage-boosting (Minor, Major or Taken Spec) mod.

With Overload ARs (and a rework) looming, a 20% Vorpal buff for primaries, some great perk options, easy farming options, and 720s generally shredding for CQC, I can foresee Arctic Haze being very viable (or at the least, very fun). Dragonfly is fun. Unrelenting is amazing in PvE now. The Recoil Direction naturally sucks, but it had to be reigned in somewhere." tags:pve

If all the stars align, and you can nail down Accurized, Range masterwork, and a Range-oriented barrel, you're onto a very unique, very strong competitor. The slim perk pool is filled with great combinations (Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip, EotS/Rangefinder, Rapid Hit/RF, Rapid Hit/Kill Clip) that can make for a fantastic gun - its main shortcoming just stems from how you obtain it, being a random chance from one encounter in a non-farmable Raid that the casual playerbase isn't that keen on." tags:pvp

Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots.

I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off.

Explosive Rounds are incredibly strong on harder-hitting weapons, coupling with High-Cal due to the massive flinch they give off allowing you to challenge less-confident Snipers (and occasionally LFRs).

// Chroma Rush - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)

Perfect natural recoil direction, hefty stability, PvE + PvP perk options, and it just feels great in general.

Typically, you'll want (Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado) or (Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip). There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload/Range] "One of the coolest, best-shadering Hand Cannons in the franchise, that's thoroughly under-appreciated due to a fairly stale PvE meta for 180RPMs lacking explosive ammunition. Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu. I think if 180s were given a chance to shine (outside of seasons where they're an Overload damage type), the IKELOS_HC would see some great success." tags:pve

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

// The Hothead (Adept) - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon.

It's heartbreakingly poor to farm for, however, as I'm roughly 2000 Strikes in since its introduction, with not really anything to show for it. Perhaps it becomes more accessible post-weapon crafting." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "The main differentiator for Blast Battue is being able to run Clown Cartridge / Chain Reaction. I've kept the perk pool incredibly small on this wish list entry, so if you have this roll, I believe it to be the only one worth keeping (over other options). This is a general use ad-clear, soft-DPS option, and its a lot of fun. Run Spike for DPS on LARGE TARGETS (+50% Impact damage), and Proximity everywhere else. Heavy Grenade Launchers are inaccurate - Proxim makes up for this." tags:god-pve

It's only real shortcoming stems from the lack of an "on-demand" damage perk ((Multi)/Kill Clip), though 500 kills in, I feel as though Rampage does the job well - you'll often tackle two enemies at once with a 540RPM, and Rampage helps you get an instant edge on the second without disengaging.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Stability] [Use Counterbalance Stock if you don't have Arrowhead Brake] "The BR may be the best-feeling gun I've ever experienced in Destiny. It's incredibly consistent, performs way outside of its expected range bracket, encourages playing off-angles and surprise plays, and can effectively counter shotgun-rushers in the mid-to-above-average-skill level. Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights. For sixes, if you're a better player, Kill Clip instead of Elemental will make you unstoppable. Is the BR a meta-defining weapon? No. Is it viable? Yes. Is it fun as hell?

No Distractions is fantastic for duelling, Moving Target is great for getting extra Aim Assist, and if you're someone who's chaining kills, Killing Wind will help hit successive shots (range buff = more AA at a distance)." tags:god-pvp

Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Behold - the greatest PvE slug in the game. Reconstruction/Recombination is Classic Coke, and then Auto-Loading/Recombination is Diet. There's really not much to say on the PvE side - its pretty much perfect." tags:god-pve

// Heritage - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Widely regarded as the greatest Legendary slug. There's a lot you can do with Heritage. Moving Target is fantastic on Slugs - +10 Aim Assist is huge. Killing Wind gives you a Diet Chaperone. Hip-Fire Grip is actually really strong here, and I've hit far more hip-fire headshots in the heat of the moment than you'd expect. Keep your Handling as high as possible - the range difference is fairly negligible from 80-100, we're talking about 1 metre of range (literally about 1 step in-game), and Handling is massively important." tags:god-pvp

// The Hothead - [YeezyGT's S16] (god-pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:god-pve

// Ignition Code - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (god-pve,god-pvp)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "So, it took me 250 Overrides to collect the rolls I wanted for this, like Thanos with the Infinity Stones. Generally; [Quick/Hard Launch / Spike/Blinding / Surplush/Slideshot/Ambitious / Vorpal/Demolitionist/Frenzy]. Ultimately, this is a fantastic gun, and the rolls are mostly personal preference. There's a lot of fuss over Slideshot, but you may ultimately decide it doesn't fit your playstyle - my personal recommendation is Surplus, as it feels a lot better to get into the reload-shoot rhythm to me. Slideshot for PvP, however."|tags:god-pve,god-pvp

With Anti-Barrier Auto Rifle being the only option for S15, I'd fully expect better players to move to 360RPMs as a Scout Rifle replacement, and Age-Old Bond has the perfect mix of range and controllable recoil to make that work."|tags:pve

Both Scathelocke and The Last Breath suffer from "Year 1 Syndrome", being weapons that kick like a mule.

Full Court is great in theory, but inconsistent due to the accuracy at range required, so super situational. Demolitionist is great for auto-reloading mid-DPS, and Chain Reaction makes it a fantastic workhorse for general use. (tags: god-pve)|tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity / Reload Speed] "If you're looking for the best Rocket, you've found it. Don't worry too much about Impact Casing, which ultimately amounts to a 3% damage buff. You'll likely want a few Hezen's for different situations, Overflow/Lasting Impression is incredible for sustained DPS, ALH/Lasting or ALH/Vorpal for Champions, Demolitionist is always great as a secondary auto-reloader, too."|tags:god-pve

// Accrued Redemption - [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Draw Time] "Accrued Redemption is the only Bow that can run the insane combo of Archer's Tempo/Rapid Hit. If you ever wanted to feel what it was like to be Hawkeye, having those with a low Draw Time / Reload Speed will be the closest you will ever get. Outside of those rolls, Rangefinder acts like Impulse Amplifier's little brother, and Explosive Head is always fantastic in general, but specifically for Overload Champions. You can also combo Archer's Tempo + Explosive Head on this bow, which Biting Winds sadly cannot."|tags:pve

Rampage absolutely mows through enemies, Dragonfly if you want a little more flavour. The beauty of this LMG is how stable it is -- invest in Handling and Stability and you're onto a winner. Very Hammerhead-esque, but in a much nicer form factor."|tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE/PvP): [MW: Velocity] "God, this thing rocks. Not only does the little burst of flame on the explosion feel cool, the perk pool on it has insane potential. As always, Quick/Hard Launch, Spike (+30% dmg) or Blinding (utility). If you roll Auto-Loading Holster, congratulations. If not, Surplus is very good - and Quickdraw is fantastic for PvP / clutching with Blinding Grenades in GMs. Disruption Break is fantastic in PvP (if you want to be that guy), but a bit more situational for PvE. If you wanted Demolitionist here, I'd probably redirect you to Our Lord and Savior Salvager's Salvo."|tags:god-pve,pvp

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind.

description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/hjcfew/massive_breakdown_of_the_iron_banner_auto_rifle/

// The Forward Path
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have PvP): "High aim assist, and good range and stability for the archetype are the main calling cards here, while range and recoil direction are the main drawbacks, but if you throw on a long zoom scope and a Counterbalance mod and give this weapon a shot I think you'll find it to be very strong. [...] All in all, this is a fantastic gun, a great kinetic companion to Summoner and Gnawing Hunger, and I expect it to be meta for as long as 600 RPM ARs reign supreme."|tags:pvp

// The Fool's Remedy
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good PvP): "[...] the Fool's Remedy has great hip fire and in air accuracy by default, and the lack of reliance on crits to land a fast TtK has really given me a new strategy for dealing with apes, of basically jumping and/or hip firing and spamming shots into targets as they close, and it's proving to be surprisingly effective. [...] It might not be the best right now, but I still highly recommend giving this weapon a shot."|tags:pvp

// Trophy Hunter (PvE DPS)
//notes:Mercules904 (must have PvE DPS) - "Let's be frank, this weapon is designed strictly with PvE in mind, and is not really a good option in any way for PvP. [...] Highly recommend this weapon if you've been looking for something new to shake up your DPS phases. Won't compete with a Sole Survivor with Fourth Times the Charm and Firing Line in terms of pure DPS, but it's a heck of a lot easier to farm."

//notes:Mercules904 (okay PvP) - "Fact of the matter is, if you're using a Rocket Launcher in PvP it should be Truth, Wardcliff, or one of the High-Impacts like Sleepless or Roar of the Bear. Using the lite-tracking offered by Pyroclastic is a gimmick better suited for Gambit (for the most part)."

// Infinite Paths 8 (PvP)
//notes:Mercules904 notes (not great PvP): "High aim assist, reload speed, and decent stability all combine to make this gun pretty decent when used correctly, but sadly it resides firmly outside of the current competitive meta due to the high precision accuracy needed to achieve the optimal TtK, and comparative weakness to Rapid-Fire's within the same engagement ranges. I definitely recommend trying to get one, but mostly to put in the vault until such a time as the non-Aggressive pulses get some of their range back (or Lightweights get a damage buff)."

// Traveler's Judgment 5 (PvP)
//notes:Mercules904 notes (must have PvP): "This is perhaps the gun I am most excited to get my hands on from the set. [...] Stat-wise the gun is straight up competitive, boasting very high base stability for a sidearm, and above average range, plus a decent mag size (equivalent to 10 bursts), and decent aim assist. Indeed, the only real drawback is below average recoil direction, and even that is manageable."
