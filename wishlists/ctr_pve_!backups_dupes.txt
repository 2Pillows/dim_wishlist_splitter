@description:Second six Season 23 BRAVE arsenal weapons with the Indomitability origin trait

// Midnight Coup (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds), Explosive Payload, (Kinetic Tremors, One for All, Frenzy, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors (which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors), One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

// Blast Furnace (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

// Luna's Howl (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag), Heal Clip, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Forbearance is the current best-in-subfamily for stats, and has a few new tricks with the revised trait perks. As with most wave-frames, you're looking for a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine. For CQC survivability, For the traits, Demolitionist and Wellspring together with the Indomitability origin trait all work together to generate grenade energy, but particularly with an arc subclass, so you can Jolt targets with a grenade, start collecting Ionic Traces to become amplified and then blind crowds, using a combination of Sparks of Shock, Ions/Discharge and Beacons.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. If you already have a shaped Forbearance from Vow of the Disciple, you can move along. If not, it's the current best-in-subfamily for stats. As with most wave-frames, you're looking for a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine. With one eye on the upcoming nerf to Chain Reaction, you might want to pair one of the useful first column support traits - Ambitious Assassine, Unrelenting or Demolitionist - with One for All in the second column for a damage boost to help clear groups of adds.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Hammerhead has lots of competition in the void Adaptive-frame LMG subfamily.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much.

A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much. First, a little extra recoil direction with the barrel perk will help controlling shots. Maybe a little niche, but add together Armor-Piercing Rounds, Under-Over and the extra damage from Frenzy, and you have a great option for piercing Barrier Champions. If the pulse rifle mod isn't around, Gyrfalcon Hunters can take advantage of on-demand volatile rounds to make this a year-round option.

// Succession (Shiny) (PvE first-choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod), and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling and then, unusually, Sticky Grenades is the top mag perk for this particularl roll (bear with us). Either Field Prep or Cascade Point and Deconstruct together make this a great DPS choice. Either just take advantage of two extra reserve ammo and faster reload and handling from Field Prep, or proc Cascade Point with a couple of sniper crits and to proc the higher fire rate, while Deconstruct with Sticky Grenades pulls bonus ammo out of the air on every second, rather than every third, hit because of the delay before the explosive damage.

The Hot Swap origin trait is always useful for a snappier gunfeel when you swap weapons.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Retraced Path was our first legendary Trace Rifle, and has some very useful combinations. Use the barrel and battery to improve range, stability, reload speed or battery capacity. Shoot to Loot is really useful in raids and end-game content, particularly if you're a Warlock running Cenotaph Mask to mark targets. For an all-purpose damage boost, Frenzy adds 15% damage just for being in combat, and boosts reload and handling to 100. You probably won't feel the Hot Swap origin trait with Frenzy, but it's always useful for a snappier gunfeel when you first swap weapons.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The Other Half returns with a few new perks, so if you haven't got one yet Dares of Eternity awaits! Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. While Eager Edge was the unique Dares perk back in the day, it's appeared elsewhere since so Relentless Strikes is probably the more sensible first column trait perk to combine with Surrounded in the second for 35% (41.8% when enhanced) bonus damage when in a crowd. The Hot Swap origin trait is always useful for boosting charge time and guarding stats when you first swap to it.

For add clearing, the trait perk combination, that's unique to The Slammer, of Chain Reaction and Cold Steel spreads slow stacks (which you can improve with Stasis subclass fragments) with the add kill explosions and, when enhanced, Cold Steel also adds a useful 10 to the inventory stat for additional ammo reserves.

If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, you should be able to create Stasis crystals easily enough, to synergise with the subclass fragments, but they'll be a long way away! Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover.

// Forbearance
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Edge Transit
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh how the meme’s be meme’ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Falling Guillotine
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Hammerhead
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well. Desperate Measures is the best of both worlds combining Adrenaline Junkie / Swashbuckler and Golden Tricorn." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Whisper of the Worm
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Whisper is back and craftable. What seems to be the best perks for our dear friend Xol, Will of Thousands? Arrowhead Brake is the best in slot for making the recoil direction vertical, but if you don't need that, Corkscrew Rifling or Fluted Barrel for the added stats. Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched. The final column are the stocks and Short-Action Stock is the best for the added handling, if you didn't slot in Arrowhead Brake and still want the recoil direction bumped up you could instead go for Fitted Stock."|tags:pve,controller,mkb

The best combo that I will be farming for will be Kinetic Tremors and Firefly for AoE on top of AoE. Keep Away also serves as a good reload perk, while also making it easier to get yellow numbers.

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

// Luna's Howl
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Luna's Howl is back and retains its precision frame, while firing at 140 RPM. If you don't have a good Zaouli’s Bane or Igneous Hammer with Heal Clip this can substitute. There's no shortage of Incandescent hand cannons. Magnificent Howl changed from needing precision hits to precision kills, this paired with Lucky Pants can dish out incredible damage, and fan refund itself. It could be very good and fun for lower end PvE content." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Succession
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I understand Bungie wants players to get a taste of the raid weapons to get players to buy the expansions and then play the raids, but Heritage is arguably a better Deep Stone Crypt weapon that doesn't infringe on other weapon types. Nevertheless, there are not many rolls you will be farming for. Reconstruction will give you more ammo in your magazine by rebuilding itself over time. Pair that with either Vorpal Weapon or Recombination for some high damage shot(s). Firing Line is great if you can link up with teammates to get the extra damage." Recommended MW: Handling or Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Outbreak Perfected
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I remember the OG quest for Outbreak Prime. What a fun time. Outbreak Perfected has truly been perfected with crafting. Arrowhead Brake does improve the recoil but Outbreak Perfected has “auto rifle” recoil making the bounce a lot less intense. Bumping up the magazine with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag is preferred for more shots, but Flared Magwell for a bump in stability and reload will also feel nice. Rewind Rounds is the best perk in slot especially if the nanites count towards the bullets back. Rapid Hit or Outlaw are also great for just adding stability and reload. Short-Action Stock brings up the handling."|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Forbearance (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While I, personally, am glad Forbearance is easier to get, I also understand why there's community hesitation against it. If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack. If you are like me and don't have Forbearance, you're just gonna grab the already tried and true roll of Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction. Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction. If you're using the new Forbearance on a grenade heavy build this version could be better with the origin trait giving 5% grenade charge back." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Mountaintop (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "We can still make Mountaintop into a formidable weapon and certainly one to chase. Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Edge Transit (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh how the meme’s be meme’ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

Rewind Rounds might be better if you're using Hung Jury as your primary and taking down wave after wave of enemies, pair that with Firefly for AoE damage and you will seldom reload.

// Falling Guillotine (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Hammerhead (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well. Desperate Measures is the best of both worlds combining Adrenaline Junkie / Swashbuckler and Golden Tricorn." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Blast Furnace is probably the best feeling 450 aggressive frame pulse. Personally I liked the Meyrin RDL scope as it highlighted targets, but I can understand it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. The best combo that I will be farming for will be Kinetic Tremors and Firefly for AoE on top of AoE. Keep Away also serves as a good reload perk, while also making it easier to get yellow numbers. Shoot to Loot combined with Firefly will allow you to pick up orbs and ammo from afar." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Elsie's Rifle (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Elsie's Rifle is a throwback to D1, and another good weapon Bungie could have brought back was Murmur, the element switching fusion *from the Moon.* Jokes aside, Elsie's Rifle is incredible. Rewind Rounds or Feeding Frenzy paired with Desperate Measures or Desperado, any combination of the above will be more than lethal. Arrowhead Brake is a must have regardless of what activity you bring this rifle into, I don't know if there's a small bug within the timelines of this rifle but having Arrowhead Brake fixes a large majority of issues."

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

// Luna's Howl (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Luna's Howl is back and retains its precision frame, while firing at 140 RPM. If you don't have a good Zaouli’s Bane or Igneous Hammer with Heal Clip this can substitute. There's no shortage of Incandescent hand cannons. Magnificent Howl changed from needing precision hits to precision kills, this paired with Lucky Pants can dish out incredible damage, and fan refund itself. It could be very good and fun for lower end PvE content." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Succession (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I understand Bungie wants players to get a taste of the raid weapons to get players to buy the expansions and then play the raids, but Heritage is arguably a better Deep Stone Crypt weapon that doesn't infringe on other weapon types. Nevertheless, there are not many rolls you will be farming for. Reconstruction will give you more ammo in your magazine by rebuilding itself over time. Pair that with either Vorpal Weapon or Recombination for some high damage shot(s). Firing Line is great if you can link up with teammates to get the extra damage."

// Darkest Before
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Darkest Before is now changed up and swapped to solar. With this change it synergizes better with solar subclass verbs. Heal Clip and Incandescent are fantastic together and allow you to push out your engagement ranges a bit further because it’s a pulse rifle. The issue I have with this is that Darkest Before is a rapid-fire frame, meaning it does really low damage per shot. Sometimes needing two or even three bursts for a red bar. Almost any other frame would be incredible. What a shame." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

No, nothing really is in this game. But it can compete for sure. Rapid Hit and Desperado are both great perks. Relentless being Strand allows it Slice and Hatchling that Messenger cannot get.

// The Slammer
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "New sword? I am pretty excited for the Slammer. Being a Zoom sword with some interesting combos means it will most likely find itself in my loadouts. Eager Edge will be great for most players, but if you’re looking for maximum damage I would recommend Relentless Strikes for ammo back. Chain Reaction and Thresh are also great options with some of the fourth column perks. Bait and Switch will be the best for pure damage, but Cold Steel for Stasis synergy and helping with champions might be a great play." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Judgment
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Judgment got an upgrade going from Kinetic to Stasis. While now it competes with the very dominant and popular Eyasluna, both being from a dungeon makes the competition also even. Headstone also being in the third column gives Judgment a huge edge. Being able to rock a damage perk and Headstone elevate Judgement past Eyasluna, however, Eyasluna is also able to get Unrelenting for better health. To each their own, but that is what makes Destiny so great." Recommended MW: Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Dragonfly and Voltshot is an incredibly unique combination. Dragonfly doesn’t extend the Voltshot radius, but extra boom and zap does clear a room faster than one or the other.

// A Sudden Death
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A Sudden Death is not a great shotgun for PvE, while you do have Envious Assassin and One-Two Punch which together allow you to never worry about reloading, I find rapid-fire frames at the opposite end of the shotgun spectrum better for One-Two Punch. Trench Barrel and Grave Robber are great combinations for “maining” this shotgun but an even better combination would be Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace, the issue with this combo is that it’s a shotgun and not a primary ammo weapon."

@title:Reprised Prophecy and Trials of the Nine weapons
@description:Refreshed Prophecy dungeon and Trials of the Nine weapons with Crossing Over origin trait

// Adjudicator (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling), (Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Subsistence), Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Adjudicator has decent stats and, with a precision frame, you don't need to worry too much about the published Recoil Direction. A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload, for you to keep uptime for Onslaught, in the second trait column, to boost RPM for additional damage to mow down adds. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Adjudicator has decent stats and, with a precision frame, you don't need to worry too much about the published Recoil Direction. A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload. With Frenzy procced in the second perk column, you'll have a 15% damage boost, snappy handling and lightning fast reloads. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, Pve-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You can find the Heal Clip/ Incandescent trait perk combination on other pulse rifles but it is very nice to help keep your fireteam's health topped up, while you're incinerating crowds of minor spec adds while synergising with your solar subcalss fragments. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. Looking at One For All as the second trait perk, you can use the 35% damage boost to mow through enemies while, as the first trait perk, you either Cure yourself and your fireteam with Heal Clip, or automatically top up your magazine with Subsistence. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

A Sudden Death returns as void, rather than arc shotgun with the rather poor stats you'd expect from a Year 1 gun.

If you are making do, then Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling pad out the Handling stats a little as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag speeds up shots, or Tactical Mag adds one to the mag as the magazine perk. You could take your choice of either Threat Detector's Handling and Reload buffs or Envious Assassin for an overflowed magazine to start an engagement with.

Taraxippos doesn’t do anything another scout couldn’t do equally or better. If you somehow don’t have one, then yeah. Grind yourself one out this Guardian Games.

//notes:SirStallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Scouts are weird. Lets just start there. I like the idea of scouts, but in practice.. Theyre just strange. BUT, they do one thing quite well.. Precision kills. So, between Enlightened Action keeping your reload up and making the gun feel snappy, and then Hatchling helping you dispatch groups of enemies at the same time, I think this roll has a lot of low end potential for fun. Which lets be honest.. Isn't that what we all want?" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

In CQC you'll probably find the Overshield damage reduction really useful anyway, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence. With the second column, as you don't need Destabilizing Rounds, Surrounded is a great passive boost to damage - up to 47% when you're able to enhance the perk. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful in the play loop to get your dodge back faster - Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for velocity, handling and reload speed. Field Prep in the first trait column makes up somewhat for the inventory stat, and when it's enhanced it's only one shot away from max ammo, without the need for any reserve mods (one would get you to the max). Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns in end-game activities. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy?

If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives.

There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. Parabellum has decent stats and a nice clean sight picture. Round out the range, stability and recoil direction stats to your preference with the barrel perk. You're looking for a snappy reload, so Alloy Mag is the best mag perk choice, but the stability from Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell make Parabellum easier to control. Heal Clip in the first trait column and Frenzy in the second work well - Frenzy boosts reload speed (and handling) to 100 anyway as well as adding a +15% damage boost. The fast reload, means it's easier to proc Cure from Heal Clip, which you can use with Ember of Benevolence on a solar subclass. The Field-Tested origin trait is a slow burn but, if you can stay alive, the stacks do build up to have a pretty significant impact on the gunfeel stats.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Strand subclass.

You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. Combine Slice, in the first trait column, to reduce damage output by 40% from bulkier adds with Hatchling for additional crowd control, and throw in supportive fragments to augment both, and this could be a fun add-suppressing and add-clearing roll.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. With one eye on Bipod as the second column trait, as there's no Field Prep option, you'll start off with 2 in the mag and 12 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to five in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 4 in the tube at the rate of one every 4s, or Clown Cartridge provides 3 or 4 after a manual reload. For burst and sustained Boss damage, Bipod just about breaks even with 25% less damage and slower reloads, but faster firing and more reserve ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

In the first trait column as the support park, Fourth Time's The Charm or Clown Cartridge are pretty much tied - if you can reliably hit crits, FttC might get you an extra shot more reliably before reloading.

// Double-Edged Answer (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Burst Guard, Balanced Guard), Cross Counter, Counterattack
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies, or Boss spec enemies with short damage windows in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives. For this roll, you'll be looking to block damage, so a Guard perk like Burst Guard or Balanced Guard works best. This is the only sword dropping in S23 with the combination of Flash Counter and Counterattack - get in close to a tanky enemy to bait them into a melee/slam attack, and then the combination of weaken and bonus damage provides +80% damage for 2s, and +20% for the next two, which should be enough time to put a serious dent in their health bar. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun.

For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%.

// Lethal Abundance (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Alloy Mag), (Slice, Enlightened Action), Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Lethal Abundance has decent stats, but as a High-Impact frame auto rifle this isn't going to be on too many people's wish list. as a subfamily, they generally have poor handling and reload speed, so that's what to boost in the barrel and mag perk slots. In the first trait column, Slice is useful when facing tankier enemies, applying 40% reduction in damage output from affected targets when procced after using your class ability, which also makes this a good swap weapon in a Bait and Switch rotation. Alternatively, Enlightened Action boosts both handling and reload speed just for hitting a target. Pairing that with Onslaught in the second trait column should help mow through groups of minor spec adds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. Breakneck is back, and has very solid stats, although it looks like we're never going to see the OG (and OP) Rampage/ Onslaught version again. As a precision frame AR, you don't need to worry about recoil direction, so if you want a variation on the curated version, you might prefer Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling as your barrel park, but Extended Magazine or Appended Magazine are definitely the top two options for the magazine. For your general content add-clearing, the combination of Subsistence and Onslaught in the first and second trait columns should minimise your need to reloads while you're working your way through crowds of adds.

// Appetence (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Scatter Signal (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS.

Slice, as the first trait column perk, when procced after using your class ability reduces outgoing damage from a target by 40%, whether or not they're immune - very useful in boss fights or as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation.

Scalar Potential has decent stats and a nice clean scope, but you're limited by a PvP trait perk pool. Arrowhead Brake is probably the best barrel perk, although you could imrpve handling or range if you can handle the recoil direction. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are then the pick of the mag perks. As the support perk in the first trait column, Enlightened Action boosts both handling and reload speed by 50 after five hits. In the second column as the signature perk, your arc abilities should make the second stack of Golden Tricorn easy to proc for +50% damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Doomed Petitioner (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve (2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods). You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded (useful against Ir Yut) for +47% damage when you're in a crowd. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

As a former Lightweight HC that's been crowbarred into the Adaptive subfamily, the stats look very weird, with low range and stability but high handling and reload speed.

Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight.

Dragonfly in the second trait column as the signature perk is great for thinning out add crowds when you're hitting crits.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit.

// Abide the Return (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge), (Swordmaster's Guard, Balanced Guard), Relentless Strikes, Whirlwind Blade
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases damage and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC with a boss. The usual trait combination of Relentless Strikes, returning one ammo for everyth three light hits, and Whirlwind Blade for an escalating +3% bump to damage topping off at +30% for landing light hits makes for a decent, if not top-tier option for boss DPS phases. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +20 charge rate for faster heavy attacks, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you don't, then maybe consider trying to craft a Caretaker from Dares of Eternity before settling. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases ammo and reserves (adds will die to a single hit anyway) and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC. The usual trait combination of Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes to extend your ammo and Incandescent to help with add clear, should make room clearing easy. You don't need to use a solar subclass but you can improve scorch and ignite verbs further with your fragments. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +20 charge rate for faster heavy attacks, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

It was great when rockets could be used everywhere and when we didn’t have to reload via Lunafaction Boots or Rally Barricades. Currently you’ll find very limited uses out of most rockets.

// Imperative
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Most of us already have. Workhorse PvE scout. If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively. I’d still recommend Rapid Hit over both as missing a shot is extremely unforgiving with the slower rate of fire. Precision hits are going to be the goal, why not make follow up shot easier while we’re at it." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Scatter Signal
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh hey, a new strand fusion rifle. Will Scatter Signal be better than Pressurized Precision? Well neither are great as Strand fusion rifles. But for a “Kinetic” fusion rifle I think Scatter Signal rivals and possibly beats out Riptide for best in slot fusion. Overflow and Controlled Burst for added damage throughout the magazine. You’ll only need one magazine booster to hit the fusion cap of 8 shots or you can opt for an even faster firing fusion with Accelerated Coils. Overflow will double your magazine capacity giving you 16 shots, 15 of which will have an extra 20% damage increase. If you opt for Extended Battery for the 16 total shots you can slot in Major or Boss spec for an additional 7.77% damage to every shot." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Adhortative
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Adhortative is an adaptive solar pulse rifle most similar to Forge’s Pledge. Adhortative has better range, handling, and recoil direction, while losing in stability, reload speed and airborne effectiveness. Either pulse is only better than the other by less than 3 points in each category, except for airborne effectiveness and recoil direction, 9 and 10 respectively. Between these two for PvE, Adhortative wins purely for having a reload perk in Feeding Frenzy. If you don’t care about that, either can work." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lethophobia
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lethophobia is defined as an abnormal anxiety of forgetting. Let’s hope you don’t forget the god rolls of this bow then. As with most PvE bows you’re looking for a good combination of draw time and accuracy. Successful Warm-Up gives you a better draw time post-defeat, but has a bit less utility against higher health enemies. Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred. Disruption break will work best in conjunction with a high damage kinetic weapon like this season's Supercluster slug shotgun. Golden Tricorn will feel great on a combination of subclasses this season with Permeability changing this weapons damage type from void to your selected subclass. You can run a full void or full strand or stasis loadout without much thought. Just remember that the damage change goes away when you stow this weapon."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame hand cannons have not had their time in the spotlight for a while. Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer’s Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon. If you run void subclasses a lot you can take advantage of Golden Tricorn to maximize damage, making these fast firing hand cannons feel way more chunky than they normally are. Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range."

// Subjunctive
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subjunctive was the smg that could. It felt great in PvE and held its own back when recluse dominated all aspects of our life. Oh how naive we were. When Rampage and Outlaw were all we cared about. Things have shifted and more weapons are certainly popular. The only true competition Subjunctive needs to worry about is the Ikelos SMG. Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It’s not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec’ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets. With Golden Tricorn 2x you’ll have enough damage to look at enemies and they’ll become unalive from sheer admiration, and you’ll be able to chunk down majors with ease, Subsistence just keeps the chains rolling."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller / M+KB): "Our full ritual playlist weapon is an interesting one. Caster frame swords have not been strong since their introduction. So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you’ll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we’re back to square one. Chivalric Fire is a great neutral sword that works best on Void subclasses, but you can utilize either orb generation or volatility to great success without committing to Void."

// Lethal Abundance
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller / M+KB): "Lethal Abundance has one thing going for it, being a Strand high-impact frame auto rifle. Slice and Hatchling both give this weapon extra Strand utility, but on other subclasses this weapon feels like any generic high-impact auto rifle. Enlightened Action and Keep Away both bump up your reload speed, either organically or passively, respectively. Target Lock works best on beefier targets, but can also help on rank and file enemies. Hatchling works best when paired with Strand. Onslaught might be the best neutral perk, but if you want a faster firing auto rifle, just use any of the other Strand auto."

// Vengeful Whisper
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I’m happy for more variants of weapons. Vengeful Whisper being a strand bow opens up some loadout flexibility and covers your strand subclass verbs. It’s less useful without Match Game but it can still be useful for taking out shields faster. Archer’s Tempo is fantastic on bows for lowering successive draw times, and Precision Instrument fits nicely as you’ll want to hit those crits, the draw time allowing you a bit of forgiveness lining up those crit shots. You could even switch it up and go with Explosive Payload and Successful Warm-Up if you’re using this in lower and PvE where you can one shot everything to keep Successful Warm-Up going."

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although (excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster), they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this and then the SOFA (Stats/ One For All) combination of trait perks to round out the stats further and add a chunky 35% bonus damage. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10sand grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s (although you can interact with any elemental drop). The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of bulkier Minor, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can bypass that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one. In the first trait column, Grave Robber procs on glaive melees, or Field prep boosts reserves, and reload speed when crouched, and Close to Melee in the second boosts melee damage by 30% for a projectile hit. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

For the first trait perk, there's really only one to consider, and that's Overflow to instantly double your battery size for picking up ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and Champions in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. But it has a trick that now other sword can do - the Cold Steel trait perk. For single target damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. As your trait perk combination, both Relentless Strikes and Cold Steel proc off three hits, with the first two Cold Steel hits Stasis slowing and the third hit freezing enemies. That covers Overload and Unstoppable Champions. Throw on Radiant from a solar subclass to cover Barriers too, and you have the sword equivalent of Riptide which will freeze lock Majors with every third hit, and which you can apply Stasis subclass fragments too as well.

First-choice PvE pick for support against Major and Boss spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Precision Instrument in the second could make for an interesting combination to apply Sever to majors and bosses from range - even when they're immune to damage - to reduce their damage output by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity (effectively a 40% DR for the whole fireteam) as well as doing decent, for a primary weapon, damage with the boost from Precision Instrument. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand Synergy in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Collective Action in the second makes this a bit of a Swiss-army knife of weapons. Slice, with Strand of Continuity, Severs an enemy to reduce their damage output by 40% for 15s - you can use this effect on Majors and Bosses, even during an immunity phase to grant an effective 40% damage reduction for your whole fireteam.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy Minor Spec add-clearing in general content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. With Explosive Head appearing in the first trait column as the support perk for a change, you have the option to go double-damage with Hatchling (unfortunately Precision Instrument only boosts precision damage so is a bit of a trap perk with Explosive Head), particularly when paired with Thread of Evolution.

First-choice PvE pick for against Major or Boss Spec enemies, particularly with Strand subcalsses, in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception, having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice, taking the stat to a manageable 84. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag (seven) as Appended and Extended Mag, but either of those work too. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively, while Slice in the second trait makes this possibly the best special weapon to pair with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon - reducing the Severed target's damage output by 40% for 10s (15s with Thread of Continuity if you're using a Strand subclass) - an effective additional 40% DR for your whole fireteam.

For similar reasons, High-Explosive Ordnance is the top choice for the mag perk. As this is a special weapon, Lead From Gold as the first trait perk should keep your ammo topped-up and Surrounded, while a bit of a risky choice maybe, boosts damage by 35% when procced to turn the truck into a juggernaut.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one.

The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Stay Frosty is a bit of an odd weapon. It lost a bit of utility from last years model, but gained a quality of life perk in Enlightened Action. Desperado is a fun perk but nothing about this weapon will break the meta or shake up the game." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This weapon was better last year, imo. Enlightened Action and Headstone may very well work excellently together, but I'm sad we lost Thresh, which is a sentiment I'm sure not many people share. BUT.. I still think it's worth going for. Enlightened is a chonky buff and if Headstone can help trigger it, it's gonna be a fun combo." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cold Steel is Zephyr's claim to fame. Zephyr is the only sword with Cold Steel and you'll want to stack as many charge time benefits as possible. Duelist's Trance grants +60 to charge rate and both Guard Resistance and Endurance. This all allows you to heavy swing more frequently. Stacking the extra slow debuff faster. Tempered Edge also gives you more ammo while adding more impact as well. Dealing better damage is always good." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Zephyr
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I won't lie, I straight lifted this roll from last years post because I never got it and I still think it could be interesting for a stasis build. Wellspring to keep your abilities up, which will in turn provide slow/freeze in combination with Cold Steel to leave targets more vulnerable to more attacks. There is potential for a fun cycle there, and it utilises Cold Steel which is what makes this sword particularly unique." Recommended MW: Impact.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don't know how often this glaive will be used over the crafted gloves but there's a nice niche between Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee. If you get any glaive kill you'll activate Beacon Rounds, with the added tracking you can shoot off in the general direction of a thrall and with that kill you'll activate Close to Melee to deal an extra 30% more melee damage. Any additional damage with your melee or projectile you'll keep up Beacon Rounds and Close to Melee to continue the chaining of better tracking and better damage." Recommended MW: Range.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albedo Wing
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Okay here's my thought process.. This weapon needs to be really unique to justify using over a crafted Glaive. What makes it unique is Beacon Rounds. Beacon Rounds are an ease of use perk, they're built to make you miss less shots without slowing down combat by aiming (gross, all my homies hate aiming). So my plan is to make myself a one man phalanx, storming forward with homing shots that aim themselves. Demolitionist to help me panic reload, plus just keeping my grenade energy up, and more shield duration to aid in the goal of becoming phalanx. Also, Honourable mention to Golden Tricorn potentially being very fun to mess around with." Recommended MW: Shield Duration.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "One of my favorite fusions as of late has been Loaded Question with Envious Assassin and Controlled Burst. Glacioclasm will have a similar roll but with Overflow. Both will allow you to destroy majors and bosses with ease." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This weapon has a lot of options for making Res Burst the star of the show. Slideshot, which also boosts range and stability. Subsistence, which will keep your mag topped up after a kill so you can keep chaining. But the most interesting to me is Overflow. The combination of Overflow and Res Burst is the ultimate combo workhorse for me, you will have multiple back to back Res Burst shots to unload into a boss or to clear a group of mobs. It's the best of both worlds, baked into 1 gun." Recommended MW: Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "While there aren't a lot of amazing submachine guns, Cold Front is reliable in that we get Subsistence and Frenzy for low level PvE activities. It's not going to replace any of your more specified submachine guns for any particular subclass. But if you want something to turn your brain off and still clear rooms with ease. Cold Front can be it." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I cannot stress this enough.. THIS GUN HAS SEVEN STABILITY. SEVEN. I need all the stab buffs possible, so I take them. As for the main traits, Unrelenting has been tried and true for me, I love this perk. I don't always need it, but it's there for me when I do. Frenzy is a classic perk, everybody knows how good it is, we love it for it's constant damage buff, but more importantly it boosts handling and reload. This is gonna be real important since we had to commit to stability to make up for the BASE SEVEN that the gun has.." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:Panda (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "How many bullets can you shoot before reloading? Will this be a power weapon alternative of Sweet Business? Quite possibly.

//notes:Stallion (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Personally, I'm really looking for a mobbing monster here. If you want bossing, you can very easily switch from Incan to Target Lock or Vorpal, but for me I like to rip through groups with an LMG. It makes me happy. As such, I went for mag increase to better fuel Rewind, Incandescent for explosions and a stab MW to make it a little easier to use. Plenty of fun." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

The stats are unexceptional, as you might expect from an event weapon but there are some trait combinations to save it. Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist.

The best even Arrowhead Brake can do is bring it up to a not entirely awful 80. Looking at the traits, you'll need to prioritise reload speed with the mag perk - Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag, together with the Masterwork. The new to season 22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk will apply one stack of Cure to you and anyone else near on reloading after a kill, while Incandescent spreads scorch and ignite to help clear adds - two solar verbs in a single package to enhance with your fragments.

(First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Mechabre (it's so obviously a pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh) is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. One thing you could do is use it to apply jolt to beefier targets at a distance. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk. Building towards the end, Flared Magwell gives the biggest boost to reload speed out of the magazine perks, with Tactical Mag a decent alternative. Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85. Get one kill against an add, reload and then Voltshot in the second column as the signature perk can apply jolt to your next target from a safe distance for burst and AoE damage. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

Use the barrel perk to get shots to the target as fast as possible, and Spike Grenades adds 13.3% to total damage for a direct hit in the magazine slot. In the first column, for the support trait perk, saves a reserves perk on your chest and significantly boosts reload when you crouch. Explosive Light is the second column as the signature perk adds +52.5% to total damage for up to six shots for great burst damage, as well as boosting the blast radius to 100 - great against Majors surrounded by minor adds.

title: RNGeez Festival of the Lost Breakdown, Season 22
description: FotL S22 picks from u/SirStallion_, u/PandaPaxxy, and u/Clegmir

// Horror Story
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "So Horror Story is stasis now. Kinda cool, but not the biggest draw. The combo I'm looking for is Enlightened Action and Target Lock. The two of them together give you bonus handling, reload, and damage. As long as you're connecting shots you'll get the benefits of both!" Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Horror Story
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This gun will be special. Not meta shifting or game breaking, but special. For me, there's an undeniable good feel when it comes to 450s, I love using them but finding a way to best make use of them typically comes down to how I can nuke the most trash mobs in the fastest time. In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass. Other weapons with this combo have existed, and they're multiclass. A self contained stasis machine. I will be hunting for this, for sure." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Horror Story
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "As a precision frame AR, you have a built-in horizontal recoil reduction so you are given the freedom to lean more into other attributes with your barrel and mod. For PvE, this is one of the few guns that can get both Demolitionist and Headstone to quickly regenerate grenade energy (the others being Unending Tempest from the Crucible, and Fire and Forget from Season of the Seraph)."

// Jurassic Green
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It can roll Incandescent and Subsistence, but I think it shines with Golden Tricorn. You can make use of Heal Clip if you want a bit more healing but on solar hunter? This is going to be the bomb dot com." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Jurassic Green
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] I'm looking for something a little more niche. Perp Motion gives stats when on the move (which this gun desperately needs) and Collective Action gives me a reason to be on the move with its enticing damage boost (that the gun also needs in PvE). Technically this job could be done by frenzy also, but if I build in such a way that both my subclass and guns benefit from pickups, it's a win win." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Jurassic Green
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The combination of Subsistence and Incandescent came out last Festival, and I am glad that it is sticking around for this one as I wasn’t lucky enough to get one last go-around. Pairing Heal Clip and Frenzy is a handy pairing since the 100 Reload bonus will stack with the scalar from the frame when reloading from empty (bringing you down to a 1.03 second reload) Golden Tricorn and Collective Action are both incredibly straightforward to use with Solar 3.0, as well, offering noticeable damage boosts."

// Mechabre
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "In order to, in my humble opinion, get the most out of it in PvE, you'll want a base of 4 in your magazine. This way with Clown Cartridge there's a very high chance you'll be with 5 going into engagements. With Vorpal Weapon you won't need to hit crits in order to do good damage and you can take this solo without any drop in damage. Reload MW helps speed up those reloads getting you back to 4 or higher." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "AJ is going to be confusing [...] I run a lot of high grenade regen builds, because of this I feel fairly comfortable relying on a damage boost like AJ on a weapon like Mechabre. It may not be as consistent as Vorpal, and it probably won't be the ideal for long boss phases, but for eliminating minibosses and champions, this will be my go to. Throwing an arcbolt to jolt the big guy and kill some trash mobs, giving me a damage boost and a pulse AOE around the target.. nice. Throwing a void grenade to debuff the target, killing some trash mobs, giving me the damage boost.. nice. Throwing a solar grenade, applying more damage to the target, killing some trash mobs, giving me a damage boost.. Nice. You get it. I doubt it would be anyone's first pick, but it is mine." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Mechabre
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] in their current state it is challenging to suggest any sniper for use in PvE content. With Triple Tap generating ammo out of thin air, it is almost mandatory, and Vorpal is a nice “always on” damage perk to pair with it." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Similar to how Geodetic HSM is the best sword for void mains, Acosmic GSp will be the best grenade launcher for void mains. Loose Change is a laughable perk on its own, but coupled with Destabilizing Rounds you won't need to rely as heavily on your abilities to get a whopping +50 reload speed. You'll be able to clear rooms with ease and be able to bridge your loadout into higher DPS weapons." Recommended MW: Blast Radius.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] this combo just feels weird, and I like that. Cascade Point is really fun on a lot of things and I think there's a world where I run 3 cascade point weapons and see how fast I can run out of ammo. Enlightened Action will help keep the cycle going because unfortunately there is no Auto Loading Holster, so I figure a reload before you stow is going to be best. It should be fun, but it won't be winning any DPS prizes, and that is just.. Okay. It is okay." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Acosmic GSp
//notes:Clegmir (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Heavy grenade launchers never felt right to me in PvE because machine guns handle ad-clear better, and for boss or champion damaging you have rockets and linear fusions. That said it is really hard to suggest something other than Quick Launch and Spike Grenades for PvE. For columns three and four you have Impulse Amplifier to help substantially with reloads and velocity, and Explosive Light which allows you to ignore blast radius entirely (while charged with orbs)."

As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag increases rate-of-fire, which is always useful. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second, Golden Tricorn can help you make the most of the Strand melee abilities (you're going to be in CQC, with a shotgun), setting yourself up for +50% damage for chunkier minors and the occasional major, and Cursed Thrall explosions on a kill.

Take your choice of rounding out some of the gunfeel stats with Flared Magwell, or any of the combat effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Enlightened Action will take the base handling to 82 and reload speed to 84 within two bursts, if every shot hits. This will mean a fast reload to proc Voltshot after a kill to apply Jolt on enemies and tie in with your arc verbs.

You can push out the range with the barrel perk - Hammer Forged Rifling or Smallbore both work well, and Ricochet Rounds pushes out the range a bit further and adds a bit more stability. There are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded and, once you've done that you can collect any generated elemental pickups to proc Collective Action (which is unusual to see on a Kinetic weapon) for a 20% damage boost.

Nightshade is back - the same lightweight frame as in vanilla D2, which now gives you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed, but this time as a Strand weapon. The stats are solid by comparison with other kinetic options. Start by straightening up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and then add one of the combat effect rounds - Ricochet also adds stability, but they are all useful. In the first trait column as the support park, either Enlightened Action boosts reload speed and handling to maximum in two 3-round bursts, or Outlaw maximises reload and applies a scalar.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. If you're looking for an arc shotgun, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. Start with a barrel perk that boosts handling - Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling both help a little - and Assault Mag improves the low rate of fire. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size for just picking up an ammo brick and then in the second column signature perk slot, to passively boost damage for end-game use you could use Trench Barrel, Frenzy or Collective Action.

// Nox Perennial V (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Liquid Coils, Ionised Battery, Accelerated Coils), Envious Assassin, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name's a bit confusing - Psi (Ψ) is the 23rd letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Hermetic can mean something that's occult or mysterious and difficult to understand, relating to the legendary alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, tightly sealed, immune to external influence, or solitary like a hermit, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments.

// Heliocentric QSc (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling), (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Alloy Mag), Demolitionist, Adrenaline Junkie
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content (although you'll be brave to be that close!). Heliocentric (translation "sun-centred") has great base stats, so you can go for a little extra range, stability or handling with your barrel park - that's pretty much down to your preference. Reload Speed will be the most important magazine perk stat boost, so Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Alloy Mag are good picks. The tried and true combination of Demolitionist in the first trait column as the support park to regenerate grenade energy, and Adrenaline Junkie in the second as the signature perk to use that grenade to boost damage by 33% is always worth considering, if you don't have that combination on a sidearm already, but don't overlook the passive damage and stat boosts from Frenzy and Surrounded either. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter.

Then pair Relentless Strikes to regene4rate ammo one every third strike in the first trait column as the support perk with Whirlwind Blade in the second column as the signature perk to boost damage up up to 30% at 10 stacks.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Man's Tale, in it's revised form may still be thought of as primarily a PvP weapon, but it can still put in some work in PvE. Start with Fluted Barrel - handling and stability are always good to have. As the mag perk Flared Magwell really is the best choice - with reloading two shots at a time, it can feel quite slow - but if you're happy with reload speed, choose from your preferred combat effect mag. In the trait slot, you could choose Vorpal Weapon for the +20% damage against Majors and Bosses, or Shoot to Loot to safely pick up ammo and orbs of power from cover. As the stock perk, Hand-Laid Stock is a nice boost to Handling, or Fitted Stock takes the recoil to 100 and adds stability, at the cost of a little handling.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work (even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit), as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

We'll be using traits to boost handling and reload speed, so you can use the barrel and mag options to push up stability as much as you can to improve control. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The literal translation means "Before Astyanax". Astyanax (“Lord of the City”), in Greek legend, is the Trojans' popular nickname for the son of the city's greatest warrior, Prince Hector of Troy, and his wife Andromache. If you haven't got a well-rolled solar Precision bow, this is your chance - the stats are poor, but there are still decent trait combos to chase. If you do, then you can happily pass this by. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Archer's Tempo is the usual reliable choice as the support perk to speed up draw time, but you might also look at Shoot to Loot for picking up ammo bricks remotely in end-game content. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Explosive Head adds a passive boost to damage and adds flinch, and increases the radius for a Shoot to Loot ammo pickup.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage.

For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Next up is a very interesting and arguable best in slot bow. Pre Astyanax IV is a solar bow rivaling Tyranny of Heaven and Strident Whistle, but neither can slot in adept mods. Adept Big Ones plus Precision Instrument will be an incredible combination. Incandescent for clearing rooms is another strong choice but I'm leaning towards Precision Instrument as the best in slot." Recommened MW: Draw Time.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Pre Astyanax IV - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Next up is a very interesting and arguable best in slot bow. Pre Astyanax IV is a solar bow rivaling Tyranny of Heaven and Strident Whistle, but neither can slot in adept mods. Adept Big Ones plus Precision Instrument will be an incredible combination. Incandescent for clearing rooms is another strong choice but I'm leaning towards Precision Instrument as the best in slot." Recommened MW: Draw Time.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

Now with just barrels the best one is Arrowhead Brake to bring the recoil all the way to 100. Precision Instrument will be strong on this gun because you can keep a safe distance and still keep putting out incredible damage. Enlightened Action will also bring up the gun feel and help your reload." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Eleatic Principle - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am sure by now most players have a good rapid-fire machine gun in their arsenal. Whether that's Retrofit Escapade, Planck's Stride, Recurrent Impact, Shattered Cipher, or reaching all the way back even a Thermal Erosion. That being said, the only direct competition Eleatic Principle has is with Planck's Stride, which I think Eleatic Principle blows Planck's out of the water. Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit. You won't have access to a reload or mag extending perk but you can make the shots easier to land with Zen Moment, Well Rounded, or after some kills even Heating Up." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Persuader - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Did anyone want more Rapid-Fire Frame snipers? I hope so because Persuader is here and ready to take up some vault space. The best PvE option is actually a throwback repeat to one of my first "DPS" snipers. Does anyone remember the Long Shadow with Rapid Hit and Triple Tap being the best we could have in Forsaken until Black Armory introduced us to Firing Line. Persuader is the best option for the older perk combo, but is still outclassed by other snipers in the current Sandbox. Supremacy and Praedyth's Revenge are both incredible for damage, and any Firing Line sniper will compete with this one for decent damage." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Deadpan Delivery - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Deadpan Delivery is a great shotgun for most players looking for a "plug and play" shotgun. Being able to have Overflow and One-Two Punch for the highest damage show followed by the most One-Two Punch... punches. The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with. Barrel Constrictor is an interesting perk for PvE as it makes sure all your pellets hit but it would be better paired with One-Two Punch instead of in the same column." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Kept Confidence - PvE (pve,mkb,controller)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Kept Confidence is getting a lot of hype but is it worth it? We have some incredible powerhouses in the same slot. Fatebringer, Austringer, Eyasluna, Spare Rations, and to a lesser extent D.F.A. and Dire Promise. What does Kept Confidence bring to the table? Well, in PvE not a whole lot. If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do. Pairing this with Collective Action or Multikill Clip are going to be your best bets. There aren't a lot of good combinations for PvE with this hand cannon."

// Nightshade - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

// The Showrunner - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The Showrunner returns to us in an interesting time. I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

Brya's Love has some incredible perk combinations I would love to try out. Destabilizing Rounds on void has some incredible utility. Precision Instrument will probably take the cake as the next Vorpal Weapon being able to scale up damage with ease. Pair that with Rapid Hit to really get the most for your precision hits. Another great perk to craft would be Shoot to Loot to get your ammo and orbs from a distance. Not being required to chase after orbs is a pretty big benefit."

Thanks to one of my Patrons, we discovered with one reserve mod and enhanced Bipod you can have 15 rockets in reserves.

You can get some great usage in PvE with Overflow and Firing Line for some great damage but we already have a better version in Thoughtless. Thoughtless beats out every stat of Locus Locutus except for the airborne effectiveness stat. Locus Locutus has +2 at 4. So the only stat Locus Locutus beats Thoughtless in is a waste stat.

// Abyss Defiant - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Abyss Defiant is a high-impact auto rifle with arguably better perks than Ammit. Ammit doesn’t have reliable reload perks but can definitely maintain great damage. Keeping all that damage, bumping it up a tad but slowing down the fire rate is Abyss Defiant’s main claim to fame (that was a mouthful). Reconstruction and Subsistence with your flavor of damage perk will give you a reliable auto rifle to completely destroy whatever is standing in your way. The combination of Heal Clip and Kill Clip is nice to see." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Oversoul Edict - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Did anyone ask for more rapid-fire frame pulses? It wasn’t on my Bingo card. Either way Oversoul Edict is here and requires Arrowhead Brake in order to even shoot reliably. Even with Arrowhead and a Counterbalance Stock you’ll be just shy of perfect at 94 recoil direction. Definitely great, but it’s a shame you’ll have to sacrifice a mod to make it feel like it’s shooting where you point it. In PvE Oversoul Edict doesn’t have the best reload perks. Keep Away and Precision Instrument are both great, Demolitionist can be strong on grenade heavy builds. The reason why I want a good reload perk like Outlaw or Rapid Hit is because of Voltshot. Being able to clear rooms with Voltshot is becoming more and more fun, but having to reload to get the zaps is less fun." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Fang of Ir Yût - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Fang of Ir Yut is back and is the first Crota’s End weapon we will be talking about. It is a rapid-fire frame scout with some incredible perks. It might not be the strongest for PvP but for PvE we have some incredible perks. Rewind Rounds and Precision Instrument will keep your damage going and grant you extra bullets refunded. Rapid Hit also substitutes in here nicely as both perks require precision hits. Sword Logic is a new damage perk similar to Rampage or any other stackable buffs. Finally you can use this scout as a faster Taraxippus with Hatchling and Shoot to Loot to pick up orbs and ammo from a distance." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

// Song of Ir Yût - PvE (mkb,controller,pve)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I did not participate in the raid race, but this weapon was one of the first to reach my ears on being a potential monster. Bait and Switch can put out some incredible damage, and you get to pair it with either Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds, both will extend your magazine and allow you to keep the DPS going. If you prefer less weapon swapping I would go Target Lock to keep damage up and really lay into that boss. Sword Logic or Voltshot are both great at clearing rooms and your choice will depend on how you feel about reloading a machine gun." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:mkb,controller,pve

Here we have a case of “interesting but not incredible.” Being able to get both Pugilist and One-Two Punch is a fantastic combo, but I feel that most people will opt for Subsistence to forget what reloading is like. Demolitionist is good for grenade heavy builds and also for forgetting the reload animation. In the final column, One-Two Punch is the best in slot, but on a Strand ability focused build you can get away with Golden Tricorn for even more damage.

I guess I thought there were more. Word of Crota is an interesting 180. If you crafted a good IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 then you won’t need this one. If you didn’t craft one, then this will be a great option. Subsistence as we know allows us to bypass the reload stat and your choice of damage perks will slot in perfectly. One combo to keep an eye on is the Repulsor Brace / Destabilizing Rounds combo.

@title:Season 22 weapons
@description:Season of the Witch weapons with the Head Rush origin trait

// Kept Confidence (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Tactical Mag, Loose Change, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus (Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking") has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, and Enhanced Battery adds an additional shot. For support builds in end-game content, the new to season 21 Cure Clip as the support perk in the first trait slot, provides group healing on a reload after a kill - in the second, signature perk, trait slot Reservoir Burst adds 25% burst damage when the battery's full, adds the fun explosions, and needs a reload afterwards anyway to get it ready for next time, so works well as a combination.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. But then if you add Bipod as your second column signature perk, you can end up with 15 total rockets, which should be plenty for a damage phase, and Field Prep more than offsets the reload penalty. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

// A Distant Pull
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Rapid-Fire Frame(140) Stasis Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "A Distant Pull is an interesting sniper. Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them. I don’t think this sniper will really shake up the meta, but it does offer some great utility on all classes. Jack of all trades, master of none." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Age-Old Bond
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed. High-Impact Frame(360) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "I am excited for this auto to pair with a void build using both Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for a self buff and add clear. Golden Tricorn pairs well if you get Volatile from your subclass or just want a stronger weapon. Dragonfly in the third column will get beefed up with Golden Tricorn so I can see some utility outside of direct void explosions that could be usable all the way up to GM levels." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Apex Predator
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Adaptive Frame(20) Solar Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Apex Predator is the best rocket launcher in the game. With enhanced Reconstruction you can almost always have a rocket ready to fire at any given time. With Explosive Light you get incredible amounts of damage and orbs are easy to make now. Bait and Switch is another great damage perk and does more damage, but I find Explosive Light easier to work with, especially with the new mod system revolving around orbs of power. Simple answer is, use Explosive Light if you’re lazy, if you’re trying to min-max use Bait and Switch." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// BrayTech Osprey
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. High-Impact Frame(15) Void Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "There is nothing more I want this season than BrayTech Osprey with Cluster Bomb and Chain Reaction. Seeing all those explosions, especially at once, will bring a smile across my face. I’d also like to see how it interacts with Lasting Impression. Do the clusters drop on the initial hit or, more likely, once the explosion goes off? There will be some obvious testing to do this season, but I want this rocket launcher for the sheer fun of it. Cluster Bomb might be useful again when coupled with Frenzy or Golden Tricorn’s damage increase." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bug-Out Bag
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Adaptive Frame(900) Solar Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Bug-Out Bag returns to us. I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Chattering Bone
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Lightweight Frame(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Chattering Bone is showing its best footing yet. From a niche but underwhelming raid weapon to arguably the best in its archetype. Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone’s utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don’t know if the two of those perks would work together. It might be a case of the curated where you have damage that starts at the top half and once that goes away you have damage by the bottom half." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Comfort
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Velocity. Aggressive Frame(25) Stasis Rocket Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "Cold Comfort has some interesting perks but nothing stands out for me. It has a low blast radius with good velocity. If you crafted a Bump in the Night you already have a good Chill Clip rocket launcher at your disposal. I like that Bait and Switch is on more weapons now and Explosive Light has taken over my heavy slot, so while there’s an argument to upgrade past Bump in the Night, unless you get either of the other perks I would not worry about keeping a Chill Clip Cold Comfort." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Combined Action
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive Frame(120) Arc Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Combined Action is an interesting 120 for PvE. Hand cannons are not the most meta weapon to use in higher level PvE, but Voltshot combined with a low magazine can make it reliable and give you a reason to reload this hand cannon. No reload perk hurts Combined Action, almost making it unusable. Eddy Current exists, but won’t work with Voltshot, you need to be sprinting for 3 seconds to make it take effect." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Different Times
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Strand Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability. Which puts Multikill Clip as the best damage perk." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Epochal Integration
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Handling. Adaptive Frame(140) Solar Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "I don’t think Epochal Integration is a great example of a World Drop, but it is from Neumona. I guess that counts, right? Epochal Integration is a set roll, so it makes my life a lot easier. Incandescent and Stats for All are your choices for PvE, you can proc Stats for All after one explosion kill, if that explosion tags two more enemies. In regular activities this is often and makes Epochal Integration feel amazing, the issue is you cannot refresh Stats for all, and when it does go away it makes the gun feel 1/4 as good." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glissando-47
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Precision Frame(180) Strand Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "This is nice, it’s like Staccato-46 from a few seasons ago. It combines wonderful perks into a good frame and stat package. While none of Glissando-47’s stats are abnormal, the utility of the gun is already solid. Strand with Reconstruction or Overflow to never need to worry about reloading and paired with One for All or Box Breathing for better damage. Hatchling to better pair with Strand is another great combination. Scouts are designed to be safe options and this will feel incredibly strong to use." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Greasy Luck
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Shield Duration. Rapid-Fire Glaive(80) Solar Glaive Special Ammo.  "Greasy Luck sounds weird to say but is an all around good glaive. Lead from Gold works with the rise of double special weapon builds. Disruption Break is fantastic on a glaive for those ranged shields and keeps another good perk like Incandescent. It’s no longer an either-or. Redirection will be really strong on Greasy Luck if you use it right, I do not know how it interacts with the melee, so you’ll have to report back to me on that one use case." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Just in Case
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Adaptive Frame(20) Solar Sword Heavy Ammo.  "I was always a fan of the way this sword looked in PvE. It felt sleek and was the closest my Titan and Warlock got to the Wee-a-boo sword. Jagged Edge and Swordmaster’s Guard will give you the best damage and most often heavy attacks, if you prefer different play styles with swords either using them as your main add clearing weapon through Incandescent or as less of a boss killer you might want to use Burst Guard or Enduring Guard for your build." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Laser Painter
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Precision Frame(533) Strand Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo.  "Laser Painter has a fun name as you’re painting the target with a laser. Normally I don’t love Bungie’s names but this one earned a chuckle from me. I wish this was either a new archetype entirely or another aggressive frame. Regular linear fusion rifles just don’t feel as good to me anymore, and the huge perk pool just feels unrewarding now. You can craft Taipan and you’re basically done. Strand is nice for breaking the few shields, but the removal of match game belittles strand damage types for now." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Last Foray
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(72) Solar Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "Last Foray is a fodder sniper. It exists as both legendary shards and has some incredibly niche use cases. The first of which is a rapid-fire sniper with the damage of an aggressive with Cascade Point. You will certainly want to bump up the mag to at least 5 in order to take some advantage of it. Envious Assassin can also help you out here as both perks require other weapon kills to activate. The second of which is with Lead from Gold builds, the only issue with this is that most of the best weapons for double special builds reside in the energy slot. I would hate to break a LfG build by using just bad weapons for it. Last Foray is good, but incredibly niche." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Last Man Standing
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(55) Solar Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Last Man Standing was an incredibly fun gun back in year 2. I loved the combination of Grave Robber and One-Two Punch to kill everything in Gambit Prime. Discord will be great if you can keep it up by continuously killing things.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(120) Kinetic Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Last Rite is very much a solid Ritual Weapon. It doesn’t exist as an incredibly strong scout, but it does come with a solid set of perks. Reconstruction and Focused Fury do allow you to use a legendary 120 RPM scout rifle in PvE without it being Dead Man’s Tale. I cannot think of many situations where that’s necessary, nor really a need to use a 120 RPM scout. This does break up the need for an exotic as both Long Arm and Last Rite are legendary and therefore allow some loadout variation. However, the lack of specific perks like Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload, Kill Clip, or even Kinetic Tremors would bump this scout way up into usage. It’s certainly one of the scouts of all time." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

"New Pacific Epitaph is our newest Stasis grenade launcher, at first I was disappointed with no Chill Clip, but then I saw why. A wave frame GL. This brings back up my excitement. Wave frame grenade launchers are arguably the best GL to bring into any content. They are easy to use, reliable, and unless the architecture messes with you very easy to secure multikills with. Collective Action is the best for subclass agnostic builds. Redirection will make easy work of bigger targets, and hordes building up that damage.

// Old Sterling
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload Speed. Adaptive Frame(600) Strand Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "It’s interesting to see the old Scathelocke model being used. I know many vets who loved this auto and I can’t blame them. Reliable was the name of the game back in Vanilla. In today’s world the best roll to look out for is similar to Rufus’s Fury. The benefit Old Sterling has is in its frame. Being an adaptive frame might feel better to some users compared to Rufus;s Fury being a rapid-fire frame. Entirely dependent on how you like to shoot. Frenzy and Demolitionist I listed as being better perks only because Hatchling falls off incredibly quick on non-Strand builds. The extra damage from the Threadlings are nice, but don’t pack as much of a punch without Strand to buff them." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Outlast
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(540) Solar Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Outlast is a great gun with awful stats. Arrowhead Brake is almost mandatory for bringing up the low recoil direction, but you might also want to throw on a CB mod for 100 recoil direction. Flared Magwell would be good for the stat bump and reload speed. Feeding Frenzy is the best for not needing precision hits, but Outlaw is great in the event that you can handle the bounce. Kill Clip is an easy 25%, but you could also opt for solar grenade builds with Demolitionist, or Dragonfly for some better add clear." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Positive Outlook
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Precision Frame(450) Void Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Positive Outlook was one of my favorite guns from Year 1. I still have mine in my vault with 4,600 kills on it. Nothing better than old reliable Kill Clip from Curse of Osiris. This new version gives us access to Golden Tricorn, Destabilizing Rounds, and even Repulsor Brace making it a really great void option for anyone drawn to the void. Ambitious Assassin isn’t a replacement for reload, but it does help make reloads feel a bit further away instead of making them faster." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Pressurized Precision
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Adaptive Frame(660) Strand Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Pressurized Precision is a great choice for a Strand fusion rifle.

Hatchling does not refund you ammo, but does pair well with Strand subclasses. Use whatever build you’d like." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Randy's Throwing Knife
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Rapid-Fire Frame(260) Kinetic Scout Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Randy’s Throwing Knife is back! My favorite little scout-auto love child. This time with random rolls!!! I do enjoy seeing older ritual / pinnacle weapons refreshed with more options, especially post sunsetting. It does feel good grinding them out again. Randy’s Throwing Knife was the best rapid-fire scout for its time but unfortunately fell into a time where scouts were just awful to use and did not have a set place outside of MIDA Multi-Tool or a few specific options. Randy’s Throwing Knife with Kinetic Tremors will feel great as it fires fast enough to get the AoE back to back. Cascade Point is really funny to me, seeing a 260 scout bumping the RPM all the way up to 428 via D2Foundry. If this lands for me I don’t even really care about viability, it will just be fun." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Rapacious Appetite
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability. Aggressive Frame(750) Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "The only problem with this submachine gun is the far too low stability. Rapacious Appetite has literally the lowest stability across all submachine guns in the game at 6. A whopping 6. You’re going to want to bump that up even on MnK. You can drop the stability to zero, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability. One for All is the easiest damage bonus to get as you won’t need to get kills and your low stability will occasionally make crit kills harder, making Headstone less optimal. Frenzy also brings up your damage and reload which really helps out." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

You can make this hand cannon work with Outlaw for faster reloads and your choice of fourth column perk. Collective Action gives you great damage without having to spec into any specific subclass. Destabilizing Rounds is fun with stacking void debuffs. Explosive Payload will help mitigate some damage fall off, which helps hand cannons in higher level activities, it also adds some outgoing flinch.

I don’t say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Tyranny of Heaven
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Draw Time. Lightweight Frame(580) Solar Combat Bow Primary Ammo.  "Tyranny of Heaven used to be the only solar bow in the game, and its sights are really odd. In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities. Collective action will have slightly less uptime but could still be considered one of the better perks. Incandescent does give you some great AoE but I find that not bumping up the bow’s innate damage might feel a bit lackluster in higher end activities." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk and then, in the second column as the signature perk, One For All is an easy-to-proc 35% boost to damage for add clear, or to take on the occasional major.

@title:Season 21 Last Wish weapons
@description:The Giggity episode, presenting reprised Last Wish raid weapons with the Explosive Pact origin trait

// Chattering Bone (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, (Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag), Kill Clip, Rampage
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag will speed up the reload with ideally a reload speed masterwork (fast reloads keep the two damage perks uptime maximised), as well as adding in some stability and, in the latter's case, an extra burst. The old spicy Kill Clip/Rampage roll is still available, and is unique on a pulse rifle to this weapon as at S21. Proccing both gives a whopping 66.2% damage bump to go on a roll with. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell in the magazine add reload speed, stability and, for the former, an extra burst. Pair that with Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk, to make successive bursts easier to land and boost reload speed further. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc.

// Transfiguration (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. The range is pretty good - Fluted Barrel, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful bumps to stats, or if you want to push the range out by a few metres more, Hammer-Forged Rifling can also work in the barrel. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. This is the only scout rifle you can roll with Rampage and Kill Clip together which, when procced together, add 66.4% damage - possibly one that's more for memes, but it could still be fun. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage.

// The Supremacy (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel), Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Fourth Times the Charm
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2) with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Age-Old Bond (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use). If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). Successful Warm-Up is a rare addition to the first trait column as a support perk option - proccing it will drop the draw time to 330ms for 6s, up to a maximum of 20s. In the second slot, Golden Tricorn for the flat 15% damage boost after a kill, jumping to 50% with a solar ability kill, or Incandescent for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot.

Fortunately, there are season 21 perk combinations that can help with that! Start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk. You can go one of two ways with the magazine - either look for a perk that helps with reload or enjoy a combat effect perk and let the traits do the heavy lifting. While there are additional reload perks in the first trait column, you shouldn't really need them, so Wellspring offers useful ability energy on kills as your support trait. Then, in the second trait column as your signature perk, Frenzy maxes out handling and reload speed when procced, as well as providing a solid 15% weapon damage boost.

In the second trait column, as your signature perk, the second tier of Golden Tricorn can be difficult to proc with Stasis - shattering a target that's frozen with a Glacier Grenade will do it or, if you're a Hunter, your Shurikens will also work. To support that, you could go one of two ways with your first column trait - Rapid Hit, to speed up the reload speed and take full advantage of the 50% damage boost, or Pugilist to get melee energy back so you can proc it again sooner.

It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

// Loaded Question (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game activities. Loaded Question is back, and has some interesting new combinations. Being a high-impact fusion rifle, there are only five bolts, so stability is slightly less of an issue - Fluted Barrel adds useful handling, and Hammer-Forged Rifling or Smallbore add Range as the barrel perk. There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, can be used with Controlled Burst - hit all the bolts to get +20% to damage and 10% reduced charge time to burst down Majors and maybe for the occasional boss DPS phase.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. High-Impact Rocket Launchers are meant for add-clear - they have the highest blast radius stat of the subfamilies and do middling damage - 10% less than Adaptives or Aggressives. And saying that, BrayTech Osprey has the worst stats in its subfamily. But there might be an interesting roll for burst damage worth looking at anyway. Increase the velocity stat with the barrel and masterwork - Quick Launch and Hard Launch are the best options, and Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage. In the first trait column as the support perk, for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against a Boss, Field Prep for the extra reserves, which means you only have to run two reserves mods for the maximum number of rockets, and have the reload speed boost when crouched. In the second trait slot as the signature perk, Bipod could be very interesting - two in the mag, even with the loss of damage being offset by less need to reload. Maybe one to keep, just in case.

In the second slot, the new-for-Lightfall Kinetic Tremors as the signature perk adds bonus AoE damage for 12 hits (or four bursts), damaging the stunned Champion and any adds within 5m.

In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, and Unstoppable Force as the second column signature perk is a natural pairing, boosting damage by 20% for blocking the same damage with your shield.

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Submachine guns are the perfect run and gun weapon. They have better range than a sidearm, and feel better for a more run-and-gun play style than an auto rifle. Surrounded is the best damage perk for running into a group of enemies, and threat detector just enhances stats. Nothing like immediate damage." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Title
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For me personally, I like to full send into one particular element, Void Subclass with Void Weapons, making the most of the keywords from the subclass. As such, I don't value Pugilist for void. I just don't like the melee abilities for the most part and that's okay. [...] I do wish Repulsor was a column 3 perk, but I understand why it isn't. All that combined with Classy Contender will make this weapon a mainstay on my Gyrfalcon hunter or Devourlock once Volatile Flow is no longer on our artifact." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Title
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This year my Titan is going to lean heavily into Repulsor Brace. I am one of the few that enjoys the shield throw in PVE, and this combo will ensure that I always have one ready. Endless shield throws and volatile enemies guarantee that my Titan can rest easy knowing he will always have an overshield to protect him." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Speedy reloads and threadlings? Heck yeah boi. Definitely go for Arrowhead Brake so you have a decent recoil direction. Lightweight scouts don't need much but anything helps. Tactical Mag or Appended Mag are going to be the best here. Small shout out to Flared Magwell, but with Outlaw you won't need a lot of reload. I'd take more bullets for this one." Recommended MW: Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Everybody is going to be looking for Hatchling on this thing, so I'm not unique in that respect. A strand scout is new and unique, so leaning into that newness and uniqueness is great, absolutely worth it. However.. I am not going to be looking for Outlaw, instead I'm looking for FTTC. Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw. Obligatory Arrowhead because even on a scout rifle, 54 RD is brutal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Taraxippos
//notes:Sneecher (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A new Strand weapon enters the fray! I'm always excited to get a new weapon type to add to my toolbox, and this weapon immediately gives us the Outlaw/Hatchling combo I've been waiting for (I still love you Round Robin). I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon. If you are intent on using this for GMs, you'll want Explosive Payload or maybe even Focused Fury instead." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt.

The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, Controller, M+KB

// Acasia's Dejection
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(1000) Solar Trace Rifle Special Ammo.  "Acacia's Dejection is a super fun trace rifle with Reconstruction and Target Lock. Paracausal Affinity is great for instant 20 percent damage. Depending on what you’d like to use this trace rifle for you can either blitz majors and champs with it or clear out rooms of enemies with incredible damage. I would definitely farm for this trace rifle." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(300) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Allied Demand is extremely similar to Buzzard, however, there will be no adept mods to bring up stats or damage in PvE. Rapid Hit is by and large the best perk to look for. Subsistence is also good if you’re in lower tiered PvE. Frenzy is the best in slot perk with either third column perk. Multikill Clip pairs better with Rapid Hit than Subsistence." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Astral Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(55) Kinetic Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Astral Horizon graces yet again. No quickdraw but that’s okay. One-Two Punch and Pugilist are the best combos together, but lack a reliable reload perk. Surplus and Slideshot both reload your weapon but it’s not the same as Auto-Loading Holster or Grave Robber." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Autumn Wind
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(540) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Autumn Wind is a fun return to our sandbox. Arrowhead Brake is a must have on these pulses. 93 recoil direction is near perfect for PvE, but I would hesitate to bring a rapid-fire frame into higher end PvE. Demolitionist and Frenzy are great on grenade heavy builds. Freny brings up the reload so you won’t have to invest hard into that one particular stat." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Basso Ostinato
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(140) Void Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Basso Ostinato is an interesting shotgun. We have gotten a few new aggressive frame shotguns recently, especially within this DLC. The interesting thing about this shotgun is the inclusion of Nanotech Tracer Rockets pushes this shotgun a little over the edge compared to its brothers and sisters. You will want to increase Basso Ostinato’s handling to make swaps a lot less painful. Envious Assassin and Grave Robber are great options depending on what you’re using this shotgun for and with. If you are using Basso Ostinato as a DPS weapon or mob killer, then something like Trench Barrel or Destabilizing Rounds will be perfect with Envious Assassin. If you punch a lot you can pair Grave Robber with either of the punchy perks." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Battle Scar
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Lightweight(450) Kinetic Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "It's interesting to see this pulse come back this season. Battle scar was not utilized much in year 1, this season it has some utility in Kinetic Tremors for clearing groups. If you're hurting for a good PvE pulse this will suffice. There are much better dedicated rolls, but this will do just fine." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Bite of the Fox
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(72) Kinetic Sniper Rifle Special Ammo.  "Bite of the Fox finally returns to us in a better capacity. Envious Assassin and Vorpal Weapon will bump up your magazine and give some incredible damage. It’s not a dedicated high-dps weapon for raid bosses, but could be better for GMs or general strikes." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Briar's Contempt
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Charge Time. Aggressive(533) Solar Linear Fusion Rifle Heavy Ammo.  "Briar’s Contempt might be better than Stormchaser or Fire and Forget. Being able to slot Adept mods is incredibly useful. That alongside Reconstruction and Frenzy could make for a solid DPS weapon. It loses 5 percent of damage without Firing Line but does make up for that in non-precision damage. Firing Line only deals bonus precision damage. Will the extra magazine make up for the lack of damage? I know Adept Big Ones will certainly make up for it. Being able to use this fusion against any beefy enemy regardless of spec mod you have on is perfect." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Now that it can roll Adept mods I love it even more. In PvE you can roll Kinetic Tremors which will give Buzzard a bit more utility in higher-end content. Overflow is arguably one of my favorite perks in the game. Perpetual Motion also needs you to be mobile, easy with a sidearm as you have to get close. Compulsive Reloader is easy to use but falls off quickly with the low magazine size." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

They just feel the overall in PvP, PvE, and PvEvP. They might not always be meta but they feel good to shoot without investing a lot into their stats. If you run Arrowhead Brake you will have perfect recoil, Envious Assassin will overflow the magazine.

Then Coronach-22 will be perfect for you. A slightly higher range slower rpm auto instead of submachine gun. You can roll Envious Assassin if you swap weapons a lot, or Feeding Frenzy for pure reload speed. Incandescent for clearing rooms and Target Lock for damage against champs or majors." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(720) Arc Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "While I like Dark Decider coming back and more Veist-Rapid Fire Frame autos is never a bad thing. They are incredibly fun to use. It harps back to Vanilla when I used Hollow Earth nearly every day. A better version in this economy? Heck yeah. Golden Tricorn with an Arc subclass will give you damage that scales up to almost GM level activities. Dragonfly gives you some great add clear potential with Veist Stinger to keep up the shooting, pair that with Subsistence and you can almost non-stop firing.

// Death's Razor
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Impact. Vortex(20) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "I love that warlocks get a spin-to-win sword. I would love to see class agnostic heavy and lightweight frame swords, but I digress. For Death's Razor you'll want similar rolls to your old Falling Guillotines. The difference would be Valiant Charge for a bit more zoom. Duelist's Trance for better charge rate. Or Destabilizing Rounds for better add clear while maintaining some good damage. Lots to do with more utility over Guillotine which was only damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Dimensional Hypotrochoid
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Blast Radius. Compressed Wave(120) Stasis Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo.  "I have been having a lot of fun with this grenade launcher. The only thing keeping me from using it more is Bungie’s floor textures sending the wave in every direction but the enemy. Envious Assassin and Chain Reaction can be really fun for using this grenade launcher as a mock add-clear weapon when swapping between weapons. Field Prep and Vorpal Weapon would be interesting for boss damage if the boss is reliably on the ground. I might update this once Dimensional Hypotrochoid gets a buff." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Ecliptic Distaff
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Shield Duration . Adaptive(55) Void Glaive Special Ammo.  "Well this is our vendor weapon this season. Replenishing Aegis will reload your weapon which will help continue your Destabilizing Rounds to keep clearing rooms of enemies." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Exalted Truth
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(140) Void Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Exalted Truth has few perks going for it in PvE. Outlaw and Repulsor Brace are good on void builds but fall off immediately on anything else. Frenzy is good for neutral damage and Multikill Clip is best used where you can one-shot most enemies and is overkill at best." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Having access to Valiant Charge in the third column makes this the sword to come up in a while. It's unfortunate that Goldtusk is hunter specific as getting Valiant Charge with another great add clearing perk like Chain Reaction gives this sword no choice between movement or add clear. One for All is also great for dealing better shatter damage against bosses." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Pinpoint Slug(65) Arc Shotgun Special Ammo.  "Do you have a FILO? If not this is your chance, if you do then don’t bother in PvE with Gunnora’s Axe. It serves its purpose as a quick damage alternative." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Hand in Hand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(55) Arc Shotgun Special Ammo.  "I used the crap out of Hand in Hand back in Forsaken for solar kills during my grind for Luna's Howl. Now it's an aggressive frame and arc. Weird how that glow up happened. Golden Tricorn with any of the arc subclasses will keep your high damage up constantly. The issue is the third column. Ensemble will be with a group and as long as you're near them. Slideshot can be good for solo play. Dual loader would be good if you know you'll only be reloading outside of combat." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Harsh Language
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Wave(72) Void Grenade Launcher Special Ammo.  "It's fun to see more Truthteller clones out in the wild. Harsh Truths competes with Truthteller and all the other wave frame GLs. Truthteller served me very well in a lot of GM attempts so I'm expecting a lot from this GL. Disruption Break was extremely strong and Destabilizing Rounds looks to be even stronger. Especially paired with Envious Assassin for a larger magazine you can two shot without even getting a kill with this GL." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

While I never got behind this weapon I am upset that Hung Jury SR4 has had three different versions in D2 and its original version in D1. Give me back the Black Armory weapons please and thank you. In terms of this new-new version of Hung Jury SR4 you will want Kinetic Tremors or Firefly for your AoE damage. Frenzy gives you some great damage coupled with any spec mod. Rapid Hit is a bit overkill for reload but gives decent stability. Arrowhead Brake brings up the recoil direction to 100 for an easy shooting experience." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(500) Arc Fusion Rifle Special Ammo.  "Iterative Loop needs better recoil direction. You might almost want to run counterbalance mod on it at all times. Accelerated Coils bumps up your damage per second. Lead from Gold is a very fun build and this could be a great major / champ killer. Compulsive Reloader and Voltshot would make a great pairing and clear rooms quickly.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(390) Solar Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo.  "Hey hey, a “new” not so new weapon. Unlike the last few this is truly a reprised version. Jorum’s Claw is a fun pulse that needs Arrowhead Brake to even be considered useful. In PvE you really don’t have a lot of choice. Outlaw and Arrowhead Brake are required. A mag extending perk is useful but not required. Frenzy does limit the need for outlaw but there aren’t really a lot of perks in that column I would take. Golden Tricorn has become one of my favorite perks to recommend for the sheer damage coupled with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Koraxis’s Distress is nothing special. Paracausal Affinity will bump up your damage with either a kill or a Strand kill. Easily making it one of the better choices for damage perks.

If you like pure damage you can roll with Field Prep for faster reloads and more reserves and your choice of damage perks. Full Court for longer ranged damage phases, Explosive Light stacked with surge mods, and Vorpal for plain Jane damage.

I would love to see if the Dragonfly damage causes the volatile to explode meaning one shot can wipe out groups with ease. I would love to add this shotgun to my arsenal." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Rufus's Fury (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Rapid-Fire(720) Strand Auto Rifle Primary Ammo.  "I have been seeing a LOT of buzz about Rufus’s Fury (also arguably the most fun to say: Rufus’s’s’s’s’s’s’s’s) Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds will extend your magazine further than other auto rifles of its class. Target Lock will deal great damage but Paracausal Affinity is going to be the play, especially if you invest into Strand. Hatchling is also fun if you invest into Strand more for the Threadlings for damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Senuna SI6
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Omolon Adaptive(491) Stasis Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "Boy do I love these Omolon sidearms. They just feel so good to use. Omolon Fluid Dynamics aside, these have always been one of my favorite classes of sidearms. Being that Senuna SI6 is stasis, the best perk for it is Headstone. Being able to slow and deal AoE damage off of a single kill is extremely strong. We all know how strong Disorienting Grenades are. Slow is just a different version of that. I don’t have to tell you all that. Feeding Frenzy is your best bet if you are “maining” this sidearm, but Envious Assassin could be fun. I don’t love it on primary ammo weapons as you should be using these the most, but depending on your build you could be swapping more than me. Another great perk to look out for is Golden Tricorn. Less useful if you don’t use Stasis, but extremely strong now with our current surge mods." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Synchronic Roulette
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Precision(600) Strand Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Similar to Round Robin I don’t super love Envious Assassin on primaries. It can be nice in swap builds or with another good add-clearing weapon. Kill Clip is interesting as if your magazine is overflown you cannot reload for Kill Clip’s bonus. I would take Envious Assassin as a nice bonus but not a feature you rely on. Target Lock is nice but a quick 25 percent damage bonus immediately is nice." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Hero's Burden
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Adaptive(900) Void Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "Destabilizing Rounds is going to allow The Hero’s Burden to outclass Funnelweb or Unforgiven. Both have incredibly useful perk pools and use cases. However, being able to spread volatile without an ability just makes the synergy with Void 3.0 that much better. Kill Clip is easy to use and is refreshable so you can opt for pure damage." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Is it the best submachine gun since Recluse? I don’t think so. Is it the best weapon in the sandbox? Also not true. Is Immortal incredibly strong? Very much so.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(750) Void Submachine Gun Primary Ammo.  "I don’t know about the Title coming back this season. It is better than Cold Front in every stat except for handling and recoil direction. The Title doesn’t have any good reload perks other than artificially increasing the magazine through Envious Assassin, moving with Perpetual Motion, or having enemies near you with Threat Detector. I don’t know about you but I sometimes prefer just a good reload perk. Threat Detector and Surrounded will make quick work of just about any horde mode, but falls off as soon as you’re out of combat. Vorpal is plain Jane damage and Repulsor Brace only works with void debuffs. If the Title rolled with Destabilizing Rounds and Repulsor Brace it would be a different conversation." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Wizened Rebuke
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. High-Impact(960) Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo.  "In PvE there isn’t a lot to say about Wizened Rebuke. No Reservoir Burst and no reload perk gives this utility next to zero. Don’t use it." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Crown-Splitter doubled with Strongholds will make for a very fun build. You will be able to have health, class ability energy, and zoomies all by blocking. Certainly a favorite for Stronghold lovers." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Trust
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Reload. Aggressive(180) Solar Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Trust has also returned to us from the archives. Being able to roll more perks than ever before is both a blessing and a curse. Rapid Hit is best in slot, Outlaw or Triple Tap are great for a quick reload or extending the magazine. Incandescent will clear groups of enemies, but 180 hand cannons just aren’t PvE meta. They do feel fantastic to shoot, I will give them that. Frenzy will bring up your reload so you won’t necessarily need a reload perk, and Solar is an easy enough class to keep Golden Tricorn up consistently. Whichever floats your boat." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

Firing Line or Focused Fury will be great for damage and being able to roll Subsistence with Killing Tally is the best thing since 21 percent Delirium.

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clearing in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Mykel's Reverence is no different - this is the best rapid-fire sidearm. With a Recoil Direction of 96, you can spec into your preference of Range, Stability and/or Reload Speed in the barrel and magazine. Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with Frenzy as the second column signature perk to effectively extend the magazine and keep the 15% damage boost going. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius (let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion), or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel.

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

To improve your gunfeel, in the first trait slot as you r support perk, Perpetual Motion adds a decent bump to handling, stability and reload speed, or if you want extra range then Keep Away boosts that, reload speed and accuracy. Osmosis, as your signature perk in the second trait column is fairly rare and will pick up any of the energy synergies from your subclass (say, volatile rounds when that's procced by a void ability) - if you haven't already got a pulse rifle with the perk, then this would be worth hanging on to.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and burst damage to Majors in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. In the first trait column Envious Assassin can give you up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon, but Field Prep, Threat Detector or Stats for All are all worth considering as a support perk. Void subclasses provide a great toolkit to trigger the second stack of Golden Tricorn for 50% bonus damage, in the second trait column for your signature perk.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently (as at v7.0.0.6) in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot (and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much). As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

Handling is the standard play for shotguns, so Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling are your best choices. Assault Mag brings your RPM up to 60 and also boosts stability - maybe not so essential with a slower firing shottie, but still nice.

First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag.

Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with.

Envious Assassin is a stand out support perk in the first trait column, overflowing the magazine as you get primary and power weapon kills, but Threat Detector and Lead From Gold are right up there too. This is the first solar FR to give the option of Incandescent as the signature perk in the second column, which plays into the subclass verbs for end-game add clear.

// Prodigal Return (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control), Disorienting Grenades, Envious Assassin, Disruption Break
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel(!) as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL.

Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. With one eye towards building a weapon around Voltshot (this is the first GL with Voltshot as an option, although the jury is still out on whether that's a good idea or not) as the signature perk in the second trait column, we'll need to make the reload as fast as possible. High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too. Using Spark of Beacons gives you arc Blinding on a kill, which should make the follow-up shot after a kill, to get your Jolt damage tick, easier to hit.

Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your pick of the support perks, Auto-Loading Holster lets you empty the magazine and reload while you're swapped to your DPS special weapon to rinse and repeat, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot. This combination should make you a bit of a walking tank in add-dense areas, as long as you have ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Shapeable. Our first Strand Hand Cannon. Middling stats by comparison with other Aggressive Frames - prioritise handling and stability with your barrel and mag to improve gunfeel. You should be engaging enemies at a decent range so Keep Away boosts range, accuracy and reload speed, or Subsistence will keep your mag topped up. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on crit kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Precision frame SMG, so you don't have to worry about recoil direction and range is pretty compressed, so go for handling and stability with your barrel. In the mag, High-Caliber Rounds is always good for extra flinch on a bullet hose, but Armor-Piercing is also decent for damaging multiple adds in CQC, Ricochet Rounds can be run or just get extra stability and Reload speed with Flared Magwell. There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column - Envious Assassin is much better on a Special or Power weapon, but it's worth it for the occasional overfilled mag. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on rapid kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats (so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time). Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The first Strand flavoured LMG as at v7.0.0.3 but unfortunately stats are low by comparison with other adaptive frames - but there's still a choice of very usable rolls. Chambered Compensator takes the recoil direction to a controllable 90 and adds some extra stability. If you're using this for add clear, any one of the combat effect rounds (High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing or Ricochet Rounds) will work in the mag, then a reload park like Feeding Frenzy, maybe Keep Away if you're not up to your neck in CQC adds, Pulse Monitor to refill the magazine when your shield's broken, or Envious Assassin to overfill the magazine before you start, should work nicely. In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

Fusion Rifle range is very constrained, so look for handling with your barrel, and Ionized or Enhanced Battery adds extra shots. Reconstruction then doubles your mag size, and bypasses any reload penalty and means that the top 3/4 of your magazine will now proc Chill Clip. The oversized magazine means you should also benefit from the Omolon origin perk stability boost.

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Jararaca-3SR
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Rapid-fire scouts are like the precision frame hand cannons. Decent but outclassed by most weapons. Rapid hit and headstone are stand out perks but work better on harder hitting archetypes. Kill clip is neutral and a good damage bump. Golden tricorn will give you the strongest damage increase but stasis in PvE for kills is a little lackluster." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage. Either way you’re doing more damage to majors and chunky enemies." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

title:u/pandapaxxy's Season 19, Spire of the Watcher Dungeon M+KB Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zokmma/spire_of_the_watcher_breakdown/

// Liminal Vigil
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Luminal Vigil might be the strongest sidearm to date. Headstone and desperado on an aggressive burst are fantastic. You could also opt for surrounded or swashbuckler for more specific damage bonuses, but both headstone and desperado requiring a crit kill makes it easy. See a crystal? Reload for speedy quick shooting." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Seventh Seraph Carbine
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don’t know what it is about this weapon but I could never get behind it. Maybe the second iteration will change that. Reconstruction and frenzy are the absolute best perks to look for. Being able to passively double your magazine and have a damage bonus all while the weapon is stowed is too good to pass up."

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Terminus Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Terminus Horizon will be an interesting weapon to use. Being a slow firing weapon it can probably take advantage of target lock better than the other archetypes purely because the weapon takes longer to empty its magazine comparatively. Having 73 bullets at maximum capacity and laying into a boss with triple tap, demolitionist for instant reloads or rapid hit for the bonuses to stability and reload. There are few times I will fully recommend a high-impact machine gun, but Terminus Horizon is definitely one of them.." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Liminal Vigil
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Luminal Vigil might be the strongest sidearm to date. Headstone and desperado on an aggressive burst are fantastic. You could also opt for surrounded or swashbuckler for more specific damage bonuses, but both headstone and desperado requiring a crit kill makes it easy. See a crystal? Reload for speedy quick shooting." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I don’t know what it is about this weapon but I could never get behind it. Maybe the second iteration will change that. Reconstruction and frenzy are the absolute best perks to look for. Being able to passively double your magazine and have a damage bonus all while the weapon is stowed is too good to pass up."

// Wilderflight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Wilderflight is an incredibly unique weapon. Similar to Warden’s Law it fires two grenades at once. This does mean that the grenades can split off and you’d only be doing half damage. The double grenades do have two impact damages which does put them ahead of regular grenade launchers. Auto-loading holster is still the best for fire-and-forget. Disruption break is always going to be a strong pick, especially on impacts for demolishing shields. Frenzy and vorpal can work if you’re primarily going to be using Wilderflight as your main source of damage instead of setting up yourself or your team for kinetic damage."

// Terminus Horizon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Terminus Horizon will be an interesting weapon to use. Being a slow firing weapon it can probably take advantage of target lock better than the other archetypes purely because the weapon takes longer to empty its magazine comparatively. Having 73 bullets at maximum capacity and laying into a boss with triple tap, demolitionist for instant reloads or rapid hit for the bonuses to stability and reload. There are few times I will fully recommend a high-impact machine gun, but Terminus Horizon is definitely one of them.." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Tripwire Canary
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Tripwire Canary is the newest arc combat bow. Hopefully it lives up to replace Arsenic Bite. It can roll the infamous roll of dragonfly and explosive head, with the newly buffed dragonfly it should feel really strong. Frenzy being the major source of damage can be paired with your choice of reload or draw time bonuses or the AoE of dragonfly. No choice is wrong from these options."

// Judgment of Kelgorath
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Now I have not had the opportunity to fully test it but if Incandescent works with the glaive melee. That would be a hoot. If it doesn’t work with the melee it will still be an incredible combo. You could also go with the new glaive perk close to melee to increase your glaive damage. Judgment of Kelgorath is truly the best legendary glaive of them all." Recommended MW - Shield Duration.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Path of Least Resistance
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think the Path of Least Resistance is going to be a crowd favorite. Adaptive munitions to crush shields and voltshot to clear rooms. There is the classic “Musketeer” combo of stats for all and one for all. As well as some decent damage through focused fury. Subsistence I think is the best for mobbing but without a direct damage bonus you might be a bit underwhelmed with its performance." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] it still probably won’t make much of a splash this season either. In PvE the best shotguns are pin-point frames for damage, and dealer’s choice for general use. I do like rapid-fire frames with one-two punch builds as you don’t need a lot to hit max magazine and grave robber for “free” reloads. The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler. I just don’t think with all the rapid-fire frame shotguns and PvE centered shotguns the Ikelos will really shine." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Feeding frenzy and voltshot are an incredible combo and you can choose exactly how you want to craft this weapon. More stability? Bigger magazine? More range?

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Judgment of Kelgorath
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Now I have not had the opportunity to fully test it but if Incandescent works with the glaive melee. That would be a hoot. If it doesn’t work with the melee it will still be an incredible combo. You could also go with the new glaive perk close to melee to increase your glaive damage. Judgment of Kelgorath is truly the best legendary glaive of them all." Recommended MW - Shield Duration.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Path of Least Resistance
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think the Path of Least Resistance is going to be a crowd favorite. Adaptive munitions to crush shields and voltshot to clear rooms. There is the classic “Musketeer” combo of stats for all and one for all. As well as some decent damage through focused fury. Subsistence I think is the best for mobbing but without a direct damage bonus you might be a bit underwhelmed with its performance." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fire and Forget
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Other than Disparity, this is probably the best weapon to grind for this season. [...] Fire and Forget also being stasis allows you to go big damage with Silence and Squall and font of might. The aggressive burst linear fusions are definitely best in slot. Fire and Forget is an incredible gift from the Bungie gods. I would highly recommend bringing the recoil direction up to 100 with arrowhead brake. That way you can solely focus on fighting flinch. You can go a couple different routes with magazine and masterwork, but I prefer mag dumping and better burst dps with accelerated coils and charge time MW. Field prep is best for pure damage, but headstone and vorpal are probably what I will be going for. That way I can have some decent damage and crowd control. Chill clip is interesting and certainly viable, but I don’t know how useful it will really be in practice." Recommended MW - Charge Time.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] it still probably won’t make much of a splash this season either. In PvE the best shotguns are pin-point frames for damage, and dealer’s choice for general use. I do like rapid-fire frames with one-two punch builds as you don’t need a lot to hit max magazine and grave robber for “free” reloads. The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler. I just don’t think with all the rapid-fire frame shotguns and PvE centered shotguns the Ikelos will really shine." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I know this is probably going to be one of, if not, the first weapon most people want to craft this season. Feeding frenzy and voltshot are an incredible combo and you can choose exactly how you want to craft this weapon. More stability? Bigger magazine? More range? You get to decide what works and what doesn’t. Frenzy will scale up a bit better than voltshot for PvE, but voltshot will clear a room quicker." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Hung Jury SR4
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Does that make this version the best version yet? Kinda not really. All the base stats are the same The new Hung Jury now has the origin traits. It lost bottomless grief, one for all and adrenaline junkie. All fantastic perks depending on what you like to use. In their place we received no distractions, and frenzy. Frenzy is a fantastic addition and I love seeing it on more weapons, but losing things to not have as strong of a weapon next time around is a let down."

// Hung Jury SR4 (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Does that make this version the best version yet? Kinda not really. All the base stats are the same The new Hung Jury now has the origin traits. It lost bottomless grief, one for all and adrenaline junkie. All fantastic perks depending on what you like to use. In their place we received no distractions, and frenzy. Frenzy is a fantastic addition and I love seeing it on more weapons, but losing things to not have as strong of a weapon next time around is a let down."

GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Blowout
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal. There isn’t much that this rocket does that others don’t besides dropping more frequently and having more perks with resets. The same “get damage perk, get reload perk” applies to Blowout. Frenzy, lasting impression, or chain reaction for add clear are all fantastic options. Field prep for near instant reloads, demolitionist for instant reloads, and ambitious assassin for bigger magazine are all the best in their slot." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Dark Decider
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I do not know what it is about the Veist style rapid fire frames, but I vastly prefer them over non-Veist ones. Dark Decider is almost a carbon copy of my favorite rapid fire frame of all time Hollow Earth from Year 1. Subsistence and voltshot are going to be the roll to get on Dark Decider for PvE. Golden tricorn is fantastic but requires a bit more thinking to maintain 2x." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Unwavering Duty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Rose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Let me be clear here. Rose is not a good PvE weapon. It can exist within the PvE space with rapid hit and either vorpal weapon or explosive payload, but it is not a PvE oriented weapon." Recommended Grips - Grip: Smooth Grip, Polymer Grip, Combat Grip.

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

// Wendigo GL3
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Wendigo GL3 (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Is the current meta open enough to allow Wendigo to flex its tired muscles? I think so. GLs aren’t oppressive in PvP but they offer better in between than a rocket or a machine gun. It can clear rooms quickly and do decent single target damage. With a linear fusion rifle nerf incoming we might see a rise in grenade launcher usage. With Wendigo being at the top of the list. Spike will give you damage, but better utility might be blinding. If you want to go all into damage, spike grenades, golden tricorn, adept big ones, and font of might will give you some incredible damage output. It’s a lot harder to upkeep on a grenade launcher, and especially when you’re dealing with a boss with limited fodder you might not be able to sustain golden tricorn 2x. Even with that set up you will have some great burst damage." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Blowout
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Blowout will be an alright addition to your arsenal. There isn’t much that this rocket does that others don’t besides dropping more frequently and having more perks with resets. The same “get damage perk, get reload perk” applies to Blowout. Frenzy, lasting impression, or chain reaction for add clear are all fantastic options. Field prep for near instant reloads, demolitionist for instant reloads, and ambitious assassin for bigger magazine are all the best in their slot." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I do not know what it is about the Veist style rapid fire frames, but I vastly prefer them over non-Veist ones.

// Unwavering Duty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Unwavering Duty (Adept)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Unwavering Duty is the Hammerhead of year 5. The only major differences are that Hammerhead has +2 range, but -4 reload speed, +5 bullets in the magazine and +18 aim assist. They will still feel very comparable. The difference in stats will feel negligible, and the loss in bullets can be made up for via subsistence or ambitious assassin. Incandescent and killing tally are both S tier perks. Focused fury will be useful if this becomes your main dps weapon or machine guns get a sizeable PvE damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

title:u/pandapaxxy's Season 19, Dawning M+KB Breakdown
description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front’s poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Its base stats aren’t anything to write home about. [...] Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you’re in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am always both happy and sad when this weapon rolls around. Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It’s a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have.

// Cold Front
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "[...] just has poor stats across the board. With the lowest stability in its class, the lowest reload and aim assist. Cold Front is tied for the lowest magazine with Blood Feud. Cold Front needs a lot to make it feel and shoot well. In PvE I would recommend corkscrew rifling to give a flat buff to all its stats. Flared magwell offers the best of both reload and stability (two stats this gun desperately needs). Frenzy and Subsistence are my final choices. Frenzy is the best for bringing up even more of Cold Front’s poor stats. Subsistence has received multiple buffs and it feels incredible on your primary add clear weapon."

// Stay Frosty
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Its base stats aren’t anything to write home about. [...] Where Stay Frosty takes the lead is in its perks. Arrowhead is a must regardless of what activity you’re in. Having a base recoil of 55 means you can slap on a CB mod and be at 100. Thresh is an incredible tool for building your supers now that your intellect stat doesn’t matter as much compared to whatever tier you’re in. Headstone is just fun add clear. [...] Short shout-out to Golden tricorn. Golden tricorn is the best for ability cycling and weapon cycling. Being able to have such a huge refreshable buff that stacks with things like elemental wells, high-energy fire, and radiance is too good to pass up. Stasis isn’t the strongest on its own for abilities, but it might get a buff. Who knows." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Subsistence will continue to keep reservoir burst up, but newer fusions can roll reservoir burst and keep it for more than one shot. Glacioclasm is a product of power creep, but that’s okay. Not needing to think about how many shots of reservoir burst you have left and instead going 1:1 makes things easier. Easy is good. I will also give a special shoutout to Golden tricorn. SImilar to Stay Frosty, having the ability cycling and one of the highest damage outputs you can imagine for this weapon type is incredible. Void also gives you more ways of uptime and refresh-ability. Definitely keep an eye out for that." Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Avalanche
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I am always both happy and sad when this weapon rolls around. Avalanche is just a relic of year 3. It’s a weird SUROS machine gun that fires from both barrels. The saving grace is being a 450 RPM machine gun. I went slightly different with my recommendations compared to my peers. With a recoil direction of 70 you really want to bump this up to max. Arrowhead brake is the first suggestion I have. With auto-loading holster you won’t have to worry about reload speed and you’ll get all the benefits of a bigger magazine with appended mag. Finally there’s target lock. This season’s newest perk. Target lock will increase your damage the longer you stay on target. With backup mag and appended mag you cap out your magazine at 75.

The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick.

You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake.

description:Originally found at https://www.reddit.com/r/sharditkeepit/comments/zl9s10/rngeez_dawning_breakdown/

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em. Remember, if you are a naughty Guardian, Xur will leave a Slickdraw / Gutshot Straight Cold Front in your stocking. |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Stay Frosty is a Lightweight Pulse Rifle and I couldn’t be happier to have it in the game. Being a Stasis weapon, it has access to Headstone. Which not only is a hilarious perk when clearing mobs but also can help activate various Stasis Fragments that care about proximity or shattering of crystals. Well-Rounded is one of my favorite perks introduced this year, granting a stack of 10 range, stability and handling for using your grenade or scoring a hit with a charged melee. The gameplay loop is super satisfying and encourages integration of gunplay and ability usage. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Glacioclasm
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Nothing beats the holiday whimsy of disintegrating your enemies in a void-powered explosion, getting a round auto-loaded, and then doing it all over again :) Glacioclasm hits hard, but it also handles like a brick. Look to your magazine perks for extra stability and reload, and try to aim for more stability and handling in your barrel.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): LMGs are without question some of the best mob-clearing weapons in the game. So lean into that with Subsistence and Incandescent. Avalanche takes Arrowhead quite nicely (70 to 100 recoil direction) and Ricochet rounds are my personal go-to for the range and stability bonuses it provides. Give it a try and you’ll see why it is my personal favorite LMG. Recommended MW: Reload|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Cold Front
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Smallbore and Flared are both going to provide minor buffs to stability which will be felt massively on a gun with a base of 7. Plus a little extra reload to help Frenzy along is never a bad thing, so Flared is a no brainer for me. Frenzy is fairly obvious, damage boost + reload boost baked into the same perk is really nice. Unrelenting may not be everyone's first pick, but for me, this gun feels like a mobbing monster, getting healing inside that same role is just a cherry on top. MW Unimportant|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This roll feels fairly obvious. Kill stuff, Res Burst explodes them, Subsistence fills your mag and Res Burst is ready again.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): When my team calls for DPS, my choice is seldom the LMG. So for me, I'm shooting for mass mobbing potential and rocking this weapon with a double special setup. Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): This one is tricky. I wanted to look for Thresh and Chain Reaction, but Half Truths can get that same roll and it would be enhanced via crafting.

Excellent, pretty much best-in-class stats, and the precision frame means you don't really have to worry about Recoil Direction, so boost your gunfeel stats with your barrel. Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage against shields and barriers, and Vorpal Weapon in the second trait column boosts damage against Majors (including Champions), Bosses and vehicles by 20%. There's noting much that helps in the first trait column, so just take Pugilist to turn this into a Legendary mini-Monte Carlo.

// Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Voltshot, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for arc synergy and end-game content. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Who would have thought that the hottest property from DSC would be a precision hand cannon? Stats are good by comparison with competitors. Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and Tactical Mag adds couple of extra bullets and stability. Unusually, Voltshot rolls in the first trait column and is the runaway best option for add clear, and using Frenzy as a second damage perk also boosts handling and reload to 100 so you can proc Voltshot's jolt as fast as possible after a kill, which will also stun Overload champions from Lightfall (Season 20) onwards.

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag).

Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed (and an extra bullet for Tac Mag).

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod). If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage. Recommended MW: Handling or stability, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting (Major or Taken Spec) mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-God, Controller, M+KB

// Heritage (PvE first-choice roll)

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits (the amount depends on the weapon archetype). Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s (12s with the Enhanced Perk) for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury.

Killing Tally is the easiest to proc damage boosting perk if you're killing adds - 3 kills equals 30% bonus damage until you stow or reload, which you won't have to do much with Subsistence refreshing your magazine, so you could keep firing until you're empty.

// Taipan-4fr (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling), Enhanced Battery, Triple Tap, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for sustained damage against bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. An end-game LFR that you don't need to complete a Raid, Dungeon or Trials for, which works for both burst and sustained damage, especially with the Veist Stinger origin trait throwing in extra shots for free at random. A Handling barrel just makes using it snappier, and Enhanced Battery with Backup Mag gets you to the magic seven shots in your battery, to give the origin trait ten shots with Triple Tap to proc if you hit crits. For Raid bosses or static bosses, where you'll be in a fireteam as a group, Firing Line adds a solid 20% bonus damage. Recommended MW: Handling or Charge Time, with a Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, Controller, MKB

// Allied Demand
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Allied Demand is a great weapon to see come back. I love the 300 rpm adaptive frame sidearms. Something about them just feels best. Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here. Frenzy is great for getting that quick damage and reload. With such a small mag another great shout is multikill clip to keep damage stacks after each kill.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Ammit AR2
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Ammit AR2 is a fantastic feeling auto rifle, held back by the fact it is an auto rifle. Arrowhead brake is almost a must to max out that recoil direction. Incandescent is a fantastic perk on autos as you do not always get that crit for dragonfly when you are spraying thrall or dregs (sorry Misraackskell). I would also recommend going with ambitious assassin on everything just because it got a buff.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Auto Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Blood Feud
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Blood Feud looks to be the best weapon from Plunder activities. Being a stasis 750 with arguably better roll combinations over Cold Front from the Dawning. Wait just a second, Cold Front was not even Stasis. In PvE I think the absolute best combo is going to be ambitious assassin with headstone. Headstone kills do proc ambitious assassin for you to overload your magazine. It can be a little finicky but it does work. If you would prefer non-Stasis oriented builds and a more neutral weapon you can go for the most punchy weapon this side of Titan (RIP Sloane). Grave robber or pugilist with swashbuckler is the play. Just make sure to have some stability so you will not be looking at Io (RIP Asher).“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Boudica-c
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “This is a fun little piece. Boudica-C is in the precision frame, meaning the slowest firing but hardest hitting sidearm archetype. it is a fine line between an overpowered sidearm and an underpowered hand cannon. This bridges the gap nicely while still feeling like a good sidearm. Again, I have to let you know sidearms are not meta, nor are they the best choice for middle to high-tier content. But they are damn fun and you should use what you like.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Brigand's Law
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I love me some 450 sidearms, they are goofy and fun. Brigand's Law is no exception to that rule. With surrounded and feeding frenzy or threat detector you will be right up in the mix of things and getting that nice damage off. Definitely take this into a GM and let me know how it handles. Jokes aside, this sidearm is pure ecstasy, nothing less. Fun but not ideal in any serious content.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Sidearm Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Cry Mutiny
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Blast Radius “Cry Mutiny is not fantastic at any one thing being both grenade and melee focused. But it is unique in being one of three heavy weapons with incandescent. Of the three this is the easiest to get and one of the better weapons to get incandescent on. Roar of the Bear coming from Iron Banner is a rocket, which has better use cases. Fixed Odds coming from the Duality dungeon and feels impossible to farm for. Cry Mutiny gives this to players in an easy to get format.   For PvE I would use it with Solar builds, especially as one of your minor killing weapons. For PvP I would look elsewhere. The perks do not lend themselves to the best experience.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Solar Grenade Launcher Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Scout Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Doom of Chelchis (Harrowed)
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Scout Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// No Reprieve
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “I am excited for the synergy with this shotgun. This is the only shotgun to get headstone, and that makes it incredibly strong right out of the gate. Stasis synergy or not, having a pocket crystal whenever you want makes this very appealing. The crowd control from a stasis crystal or the add clearing potential is all right there. Whether you want a larger mag via triple tap, or faster reloads via feeding frenzy or outlaw. All are incredible choices.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Stasis Shotgun Special Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Planck's Stride
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Why must all the season pass machine guns be 900 rpm? They are not bad, but they are my least favorite archetype. Give me Hammerhead 3.0 please. Planck's Strike needs a lot to feel good in any capacity. Harmony being its best damage perk next to swashbuckler is a big miss for me. One for All is easy to proc on a 900, but I would rather use a primary ammo weapon for add clear 90% of the time. Keep it for collections, but do not actively farm for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Machine Gun Heavy Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Pure Poetry
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Pure Poetry is a fantastic addition to the 120 family. With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist. Any and all of them are fantastic, but slightly player dependent.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Kinetic Hand Cannon Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// The Inquisitor
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The Inquisitor is an interesting shotgun. It will not beat out FILO or Heritage, but it can be decent if you do not have either. Demo gives you that instant magazine refresh on grenade throw. Coupled with golden tricorn allows you to do more damage to targets to build back that grenade energy. Throw your grenade again to keep up golden tricorn 2x, and you have got yourself a loop. Not a 1:1 loop, but a loop.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Shotgun Special Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Yesteryear
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Yesteryear is a fun addition to the 390 archetype. I am slightly disappointed you need arrowhead brake to make this weapon feel good. Coupled with a counterbalance mod and you hit the sweet spot of 95. Outlaw makes a return as the best reload perk. Which is unfortunate seeing as rapid hit is objectively better. Subsistence is another great option but loses value in higher end content. Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! With a Precision Frame, you won't need to worry too much about recoil direction, and you already have tonnes of range, so focus on Stability and Handling, with Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell to help further with stability and reload speed. It's rare to be able to roll two damage perks so if you're looking for something that you can use against Minor adds, the occasional Major or Champion, then Explosive Payload or Vorpal Weapon, in combination with Frenzy or Focused Fury should give you pretty much permanent additional damage uptime.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for Solar subclasses in general content. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Tactical Mag or Appended Mag plus the Backup Mag mod, to help with the origin trait boost. Then, to synergise with Solar subclasses, you can craft a mini-Sunshot by taking Ensemble for the faster reload and handling in a fireteam, building into the origin trait, together with Incandescent for your scorch and ignite explosion chaining.

The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

// Midha's Reckoning (Harrowed) (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Ionised Battery, Field Prep, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag. You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too) on them all.

// Planck's Stride (PvE first-choice roll)
// Arrowhead Brake, Extended Magazine, (Killing Wind, Perpetual Motion), Thresh
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, so you might find it some use if you're lucky. A Stability barrel will help control recoil, and Extended Magazine keeps you firing for as long as possible, even with a reload penalty. Then Heating Up corrects for Recoil Direction and adds more stability, and who doesn't love extra Super energy through Thresh.  Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Major, Boss or Taken Spec) or Backup Mag mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-God, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-Boss, PvE-MinorSpec, Controller, MKB

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 26. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The first Tex Mechanica legendary weapon - a lightweight, so it boosts mobility for movement speed. To clear majors, use Full Choke to constrain the pellet spread a little, Tactical Mag for an extra bullet in the magazine or Assault Mag if you miss a pellet.

Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox. You'll be swapping back and forth, so go for a handling barrel. Obviously Blinding Grenades in the mag, and then Auto-Loading Holster to reload while you're mopping up your blinded enemies with your Energy weapon.

// Full Choke, (Tactical Mag, Assault Mag), Pugilist, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The first Tex Mechanica legendary weapon - a lightweight, so it boosts mobility for movement speed. To clear majors, use Full Choke to constrain the pellet spread a little, Tactical Mag for an extra bullet in the magazine or Assault Mag if you miss a pellet. Then, Pugilist and the Hot Swap origin perk help boost handling, and One-Two Punch adds a huge damage boost against majors and bosses.

// Lingering Dread
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Chill clip on a tube grenade launcher? Heck yeah. Sign me up. Now that blinding grenades and concussion grenades caught another nerf, any crowd control is good crowd control. Spike grenades will see a small rise in popularity with Lingering Dread as you do need direct impacts to apply the slow effect. Auto-loading holster or ambitious assassin are both incredible for two different play styles, but a sleeper perk is unrelenting.

// New Purpose
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "New Purpose fills a different niche compared to Messenger. Neither are stronger than the other. New Purpose has headstone, vorpal weapon, and feeding frenzy. Messenger has rapid hit and adept mods. I think the strength of New Purpose is its synergy with stasis as well as the addition of feeding frenzy and vorpal weapon. Both have the stopping power of buffed desperado, but having vorpal for majors and champs is a bonus in New Purpose’s corner." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Fixed Odds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): " the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "A three round burst linear fusion. It’s most similar to high-impact fusions, but it does significantly more damage and charges faster. For PvE auto-loading holster, clown cartridge, or rapid hit are all fantastic options. Firing line, frenzy, and vorpal are all really close in terms of best in slot, but I would rank them in that order. Firing line is the easiest to proc, frenzy can be your whole loadout, and vorpal while the weakest is still 10% damage. Depending on how you decide to play will determine which is best for you."

// Austringer
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think Eyaslunas beats out Austringer in PvE. Being stasis and having headstone as a possible roll gives more utility than almost anything Austringer can offer. There’s the tried and true rampage / outlaw combo. Or you could invest into grenade builds or frenzy builds." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Tears of Contrition
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Tears of Contrition is a really good feeling Nameless Midnight. [...] For PvE you can go with a very similar explosive payload roll.

// Chain of Command
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "The unique factor is Osmosis to change its damage type from stasis to whatever subclass you happen to be on. A real jack of all trades. Unfortunately it is the true master of one. Having both adrenaline junkie and demolitionist really elevate it with grenade builds on Void 3.0 or some Solar 3.0 builds, but I would rather have either a dedicated “big-deeps” machine gun or an add clear machine gun with firefly or dragonfly. I don’t really find myself using machine guns for add clearing, but having a very reliable weapon for grenade builds is never a bad option.

Similar to Season of the Cartesian Coordinate vorpal weapon is the best in slot perk to chase after. With 12 perks in that column you’ll just have to pray to RNGesus to even see the perk. The two very close second and third are chill clip for Stasis oriented builds (or general add control builds), and frenzy for neutral damage across all enemy types. I find frenzy works best on primary weapons, but a full arsenal of frenzy weapons means you won’t ever drop your damage buff." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Dead Weight
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "One-two punch doesn’t really rely on the damage from the shotgun as your melee is then increased by 200% (80% with Liar’s Handshake). [...] If you dislike one-two punch (how dare you) there’s plenty of other alternative combinations like swashbuckler and subsistence for keeping the damage going, or subsistence and adrenaline junkie for grenade focused builds. If you prefer a more pocket shotgun feel then auto-loading holster is the best in slot." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// The Hero's Burden
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Adaptive frame 900’s always felt the best for me in PvE and PvP. Feeding frenzy and kill clip are the de facto best for PvE activities.

// The Wizened Rebuke
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I absolutely loved using my firmly planted and tap the trigger Wizened Rebuke back in the Forsaken era of Seasons 6 and 7. With the fusion changes I would highly recommend cleaning up the recoil direction to make sure that you have the easiest time controlling the burst. For PvE similar to Riptide you will want vorpal weapon for the best success. Subsistence helps keep the voops going." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Enyo-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame smgs struggle in PvE content. Both of the 900 rpm smgs just pump out damage faster, and aggressive frames hit like a truck while still maintaining a lot of that spray. Precision frames have the best base range for all smgs but comically low handling, reload, and stability. All three of which are important in PvE activities. Reload especially. Enyo-D comes equipped with feeding frenzy to circumvent the low reload, and fluted barrel will bump up that low handling. I like surrounded with surrounded spec for the best damage, but multikill clip coupled with feeding frenzy is a great option too." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Lunulata-4b
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Lunulata-4b is a great alternative in the kinetic slot. The clear choice is to pair it with any of the stasis builds, and you’d be absolutely correct. Polymer string and a draw time masterwork is all that’s needed to reach the draw time floor without sacrificing any accuracy. Lunulata-4b’s low accuracy stat of 25 means losing some would nearly drop you to the floor. Fiberglass arrow shaft brings the accuracy stat up to a respectable amount, but nowhere near perfect. The clear best perk is headstone, but having adrenaline junkie on a bow is fun. If you didn’t get one on a Fel Taradiddle then Lunulata-4b is your next best option.

// Without Remorse

Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on. Having a 200% damage increase to your non-ranged melee is incredibly fun for destroying majors or chunky red bars. Pair that with auto-loading holster to keep your mag topped off is the way to go."

// The Title
//notes:pandapaxxy (M+KB / Controller / PvE): "The Title is an interesting SMG. It's got some great synergy with different builds like the All for All, or grave robber and swashbuckler. Vorpal is always a good choice for general use, but I find SMGs can't really take advantage of it. If you have a good Funnelweb, you can make this work with different builds, but for overall usage I don't know if I'd take The Title over my frenzy Funnelweb."

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping. [...] Triple tap and vorpal weapon together can help you shred some majors or champions, but the overall lower base damage leans me to recommending other weapons specifically for major killing. You can make it work but it’s not ideal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Le Monarche just got a wonderful catalyst in unrelenting, so you could potentially have a legendary lemon through dragonfly and unrelenting together.

// Cantata-57
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Cantata-57 feels good, and that’s at base. Everything else just builds this gun up to be a beast in PvE content; rivaling even Fatebringer. Ideally you’d want rapid hit and vorpal to cover your majors and minors, but timed payload is a great PvE perk similar to explosive payload. The delay in PvE is negligible and you get nothing but benefits. Rapid hit only works if the bullet portion hits crits but with the aim assist and PvE hit boxes you shouldn’t have a horrible time getting rapid hit going."

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "But it also has some incredible utility outside of being a funny name. Adaptive munitions and disruption break together create an incredibly easy to use weapon that scales up to higher tier content with ease. The lower base damage of being a lightweight frame does hurt it a tad, but for the most part that hasn’t stopped people from using things like the BxR Battler in all content either. You could also opt for demolitionist and dragonfly for maximum uptime on those weakening grenades I see everyone loves so much.

// Redback-5si

The best perk for the Redback-5si is surrounded with surrounded spec, but that is a hairy situation to begin with. I would bump up its mag, range, and spec into reloader perks to maximize this sidearm’s usage, but I just don’t think it beats submachine guns, let alone autos or other longer ranged primaries."

Unfortunately we can only work with the seasonal mods we have now, so Snorri-FR5 falls off considerably, but still has great utility in double special weapons builds as the primary form of add-clear.

// Reckless Endangerment
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / PvP / M+KB / Controller): "In PvE there are just better shotguns, where a neutral, high-handling weapon just will not fit the bill. In Reckless Endangerment’s benefit is how smooth it feels to use. No other shotgun really comes close to how fluid this feels without any investment. [...] Crucible is where Reckless Endangerment can really flex [...] Having a shotgun that you don’t really have to invest in to make it feel fluid gives new players and people uncomfortable with PvP a shotgun to compete with. The obvious comparison is Riiswalker and I do think Riiswalker takes the cake over Reckless Endangerment in all forms of PvP. That being said, you can use Reckless Endangerment and hang with Riiswalker without feeling like a detriment to your team or yourself.". Recommended MW - Handling.|tags:pve,pvp,mkb,controller

// Come to Pass
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Like Herod-C this archetype is middling but not terrible. The one thing that Come to Pass does that is better than Herod-C is handle shielded enemies with ease. Herod-C can clear rooms with headstone, Come to Pass deals with champs and shields better than most other autos in its archetype. Adaptive munitions is very strong and triple tap once the shield is gone can artificially extend your mag to make it even easier to kill those higher health bar enemies.".

// Father's Sins
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Father’s Sins is craftable but doesn’t offer as much. Focused Fury is great for choosing when to get your damage and being able to reload and triple tap into a bigger mag is a huge boon. But damage phases are moving to more mobile sets, so “stand and DPS” is becoming less common. Even still having one in the event a “stand and DPS” phase comes back would be nice to keep in your back pocket.". Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// BxR-55 Battler
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "the BxR-55 Battler is the best feeling 450 pulse in the entirety of Destiny, the shortcomings come from being a 450 frame. A push one way or the other could easily tip the scale into a dominant adaptive or rapid-fire frame meta with how this frame slips right between them. Does it feel fantastic? For sure. Is it meta breaking or a complete game changer? Not at all. To ensure it does feel good, you’re going to want to get Arrowhead Brake to get that sweet 100 recoil direction. Then slot the new full auto retrofit mod and go to town." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Retraced Path
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "I think Tactical Battery is the best option for most use cases as it adds range, stability, and reload speed. Subsistence makes it a mini-Prometheus Lens without the AoE damage. But with a perk like Frenzy or Golden Tricorn you can easily get better damage numbers. This is a welcome addition to anyone’s arsenal." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Half-Truths
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "The key to this sword is Eager Edge.

// Eyasluna
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Is it better than Fatebringer (Adept) and Palindrome (Adept)? I don’t think so. But it can definitely hang and seeing one isn’t a direct handicap. Eyasluna has an ease of use that the other two just simply don’t have. [...] When comparing normal base models it becomes even better as there’s no adept mods to socket and the farmability of this [...] will make it a very easy choice for a lot of the more casual community. [...] For PvE the tried and true pairing of a reload perk and a damage perk will be your bread and butter. If you want to get saucy something like Headstone or Harmony could be good for specific builds." Recommended MW: Reload.|tags:controller,pve

// Matador-64
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Let me preface this by saying precision shotguns are not the best choice for any content. That being said, Matador 64 might be your best option depending on your roll. For PvE One-Two Punch is still my favorite choice for the sheer damage you can get with your melees."

// 1000 Yard Stare
//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "Unfortunately this sniper does not compete in PvE compared to other snipers. I wouldn’t be using a sniper to clear rank-and-file enemies. And I wouldn’t use this sniper for boss damage. It does have Triple Tap and Demolitionist for faster mag dumps, but being an adaptive frame means it sits in the middle of burst damage and sustained damage."

//notes:pandapaxxy (Controller / PvE): "This is probably the best thing to come this season. It’s an incredible design. A second spin-to-win sword and comes with Chain Reaction? Heck yeah! Arguably One for All is going to be better on this sword as you can spin in a group and instantly get full stacks. BUT sword go boom? Sword go boom. I’m excited."

// Hawkmoon
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / Controller): "For PvE Surplus or Killing Wind will depend on your build. A higher ability build will appreciate Surplus, a more solo run-n-gun build will appreciate Killing Wind. You could definitely opt for some of the other perks here too as nothing really screams PvE."|tags:pve,controller

// Bygones (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (must-have controller) - "This is definitely my favorite primary in the game, and has been since Forsaken. The archetype by default has an incredibly easy to hit optimal TtK and it's super forgiving of missed crits, stat-wise it is flat out great, and the perk combinations on it are second to none."

// Last Perdition (controller)
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good controller) - "[...] Last Perdition is basically Bygones but Void, with sights instead of barrels! [...] slightly better stability, and slightly worse range and recoil direction."
