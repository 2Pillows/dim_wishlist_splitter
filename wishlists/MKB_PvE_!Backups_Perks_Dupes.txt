// Midnight Coup (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel), (Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds), Explosive Payload, (Kinetic Tremors, One for All, Frenzy, Desperate Measures)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors (which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors), One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-EndGame, PvE-God, M+KB, Controller

For end-game content, where running out to pick up ammo could be a death sentence, Shoot to Loot can be a godsend, particularly when paired with Kinetic Tremors, which will pick up blocks and orbs in its AoE radius when procced, and is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors anyway.

The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk.

// Blast Furnace (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent (although you don't get any of the stat bonuses). The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill.

// Luna's Howl (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore), (Flared Magwell, Light Mag), Heal Clip, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip (hence the need for reload speed) and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. If you already have a shaped Forbearance from Vow of the Disciple, you can move along. If not, it's the current best-in-subfamily for stats. The most popular roll of a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine paired with Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction has been the add-clearing wave-frame of choice for the last few seasons, and should still be good even after the planned CR nerf.

As with most wave-frames, you're looking for a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine. For CQC survivability, Unrelenting paired with Chain Reaction will help keep your health topped up in a crowd of adds, and should still be good even after the planned CR nerf.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Forbearance is the current best-in-subfamily for stats, and has a few new tricks with the revised trait perks. As with most wave-frames, you're looking for a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine. For CQC survivability, For the traits, Demolitionist and Wellspring together with the Indomitability origin trait all work together to generate grenade energy, but particularly with an arc subclass, so you can Jolt targets with a grenade, start collecting Ionic Traces to become amplified and then blind crowds, using a combination of Sparks of Shock, Ions/Discharge and Beacons.

// The Mountaintop (PvE first-choice roll)
// Hard Launch, (Implosion Rounds, Spike Grenades), Auto-Loading Holster, (Recombination, Frenzy, Vorpal Weapon)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686) with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Overflow puts two in the mag just for running over an ammo brick, or Ambitious Assassin does the same after a kill. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon provide a reliable +15%, with Frenzy also boosting your reload speed and handling.

// Hammerhead (PvE first-choice roll)

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Hammerhead has lots of competition in the void Adaptive-frame LMG subfamily. It mostly has decent stats except for it's inventory size - at base you'll have 315 shots as opposed to Commemoration's 351. With three reserve mods, you'll have 427 compared to 453. You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk. Or, alternatively, Surrounded will add +47% damage when enhanced after Last Shape.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac) with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for void subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much. A little extra recoil direction with the barrel perk will help controlling shots, and any of the combat effect rounds or Flared Magwell for reload speed and a touch of stability are the mag perk top choices. Probably more for void Gyrfalcon Hunters, with easy access to volatile rounds, Repulsor Brace gives you a high uptime on void overshields, while Frenzy or Desperate Measures are great damage boosting options. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size (so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod), and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses.

In the first trait column, Frenzy provides the largest passive damage bonus of +15%, but Vorpal Weapon is still +10% or the old classic Relentless Strikes will extend sword ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Falling Guillotine is a decent, legendary choice for add clearing, particularly now that the BRAVE version can roll with two damage perks. As usual, look for a blade perk that boosts reserves, and then Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk for a bit of everything useful. In the trait columns, for void fragment synergy, Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds grants any easy void overshield - handy for CQC work - on kills of adds made volatile on kills. If you're not so worried about the overshield, Chain Reaction can help spread Destabilizing Rounds volatility further through the death explosions in ad-dense areas.

If you already have a Forbearance crafted or Adept, you definitely do not need to grind out the new version other than for progress towards Superblack.

Unrelenting in column 3 is arguably better than Ambitious Assassin as it only takes 3 kills to activate and should work with Chain Reaction.

Ambitious Assassin allows up to two shots per magazine after a kill, if you were to pair that with Frenzy for 100 reload you could use this for back to back firing against a boss. The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Falling Guillotine and its predecessor Dark-Drinker are some of my favorite swords. I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Hammerhead
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well. Desperate Measures is the best of both worlds combining Adrenaline Junkie / Swashbuckler and Golden Tricorn." Recommended MW: Range, Stability, Handling, Reload Speed.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

// Whisper of the Worm
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Whisper is back and craftable. What seems to be the best perks for our dear friend Xol, Will of Thousands? Arrowhead Brake is the best in slot for making the recoil direction vertical, but if you don't need that, Corkscrew Rifling or Fluted Barrel for the added stats. Bungie decided against magazine extending perks so the best here is Flared Magwell for when you miss and need to reload. Alloy Mag is great if you do run out of ammo and need to reload before another boss fight or after a wipe. In the third column Field Prep brings up the already buffed reserves while also making reloading faster when crouched. The final column are the stocks and Short-Action Stock is the best for the added handling, if you didn't slot in Arrowhead Brake and still want the recoil direction bumped up you could instead go for Fitted Stock."|tags:pve,controller,mkb

Personally I liked the Meyrin RDL scope as it highlighted targets, but I can understand it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. The best combo that I will be farming for will be Kinetic Tremors and Firefly for AoE on top of AoE. Keep Away also serves as a good reload perk, while also making it easier to get yellow numbers.

//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Elsie's Rifle is a throwback to D1, and another good weapon Bungie could have brought back was Murmur, the element switching fusion *from the Moon.* Jokes aside, Elsie's Rifle is incredible. Rewind Rounds or Feeding Frenzy paired with Desperate Measures or Desperado, any combination of the above will be more than lethal.

// Midnight Coup
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Bumping up the magazine with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag is preferred for more shots, but Flared Magwell for a bump in stability and reload will also feel nice.

The added 15% damage boost won't hurt either. Vorpal weapon is another flat 15% damage boost. The best bang for your shot is Recombination. This gives you a 100% damage increase for any 10 elemental weapon kills. If you ever wanted Izanagi’s Burden in the form of a grenade launcher, Recombination paired with Auto-Loading Holster will be the roll to grab." Recommended MW: Velocity.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Edge Transit (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Oh how the meme’s be meme’ing. Edge Transit used to drop as often as glimmer. We used to be swimming in them, with how often they used to drop. Now we are asking for more drops of Edge Transit. The hottest DPS weapon outside of Cataphract GL3 (Adept). For the moment we can stack extra rounds into the magazine with Augmented Drum and Envious Assassin, and then hot swap over to Spike Grenades and Cascade Point on some Holo-foil rolls. Pair that with either Explosive Light or Bait and Switch for incredible damage. Bait and Switch will last the whole extended magazine, but (soon to be) enhanced Explosive Light will last 7 shots. If you nail just one roll out of all the Edge Transits I would look for Cascade Point and Explosive Light to be able to nuke most majors, champions, and bosses with ease."

// The Recluse (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Recluse has not only been power crept from its former self with things like Funnelweb, IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3, CALUS Mini-Tool, and even The Title from the recent Guardian Games. Did we know The Recluse was coming back to take its throne? Not at the time. But we can say for certain it's here to stay. Subsistence, Enlightened Action, or Feeding Frenzy are all great perks to maximize the reload or bypass having to reload one way or another. Repulsor Brace is incredible with Void subclasses, but you don't need to be on Void to take advantage of this SMG. Desperate Measures can work on any subclass and has great synergy with any of the reload perks. Obviously a damage + reload combo will be good but having something that doesn't necessarily lean into any of the subclass verbs can make it easier to translate across builds and activities. Would you be better with a more subclass focused roll? Highly depends on your build." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,controller,mkb

I still have my Guillotine and if it wasn't for the titan swords being so silly to run around with I'd still probably be using my Guillotine to this day. If you never got one from Arrivals or didn't get the roll you wanted, this is your time. Double damage perks in the third and fourth columns propell Falling Guillotine to the best sword in the game. Frenzy being a nice 15% damage buff with an additional 40% damage buff via surrounded on top gives Falling Guillotine the highest damage potential in the game. If you don't want to have to think about Surrounded being up and accidentally spinning too hard and deleting a few enemies from existence, you could go for a safer pick in Bait and Switch. You lose 5% in damage but make up for it in reliability. Another fun option which seems to be trending with the Brave Arsenal is the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds."

// Hammerhead (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "There has never been a more iconic legendary machine gun in Destiny 2 outside of Hammerhead. My old Feeding Frenzy and Rampage has been collecting dust but nothing else feels as good. The Brave version of Hammerhead can roll Rewind (WeeWoo) Rounds and Fourth Time's the Charm which will both refund ammo back into your magazine. Envious Assassin will allow you to overflow the magazine to over 200 if you also slot in a backup mag mod. Pair any of those perks will work wonderfully with your “damage” perk of choice. Onslaught will ramp up the RPM to 714, giving you incredible DPS. Killing Tally is one of the best damage perks for machine guns (and trace rifles). It doesn't go away until you reload which is where magazine extending perks like Rewind Rounds or Fourth Time's the Charm work well.

// Midnight Coup (Holofoil)
//notes: pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Midnight Coup is still my most used weapon of all time in PvE. I float around too much to stick with one weapon. I almost dethroned the King with Austringer back in Season of Opulence, but the King still stands tall. The newest version seeks the throne from the prototype and I'm looking to get a nice Holo-foil roll with double perks to really get the best of all worlds. Firefly is arguably the best perk in the third column as it provides AoE damage, and a reload speed bump. This way you won't have to spec into reload at all as the base 56 gets brought up to 100 with Firefly. Explosive Payload is also a flat damage increase in PvE and helps with stunning champions when Hand Cannon mods are up. Finally we have Shoot to Loot, this coupled with the next perk in column 4 can pick up orbs and ammo from across the map. That specific perk is Kinetic Tremors. Kinetic Tremors will activate after 6 shots, which will most likely happen against bosses, champions, or majors. If you wanted a more “on demand” perk, you could choose One for All which has the potential to ramp up after just one well timed and placed crit, knock out 3 enemies and you've got a 35% damage increase. The final perk you should at least try is Desperate Measures, it works with any ability build and allows you to flex between Swashbuckler / Adrenaline Junkie and Golden Tricorn; it isn't as build specific as the former two, and it is refreshable unlike the latter."

Nevertheless, there are not many rolls you will be farming for. Reconstruction will give you more ammo in your magazine by rebuilding itself over time.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You can find the Heal Clip/ Incandescent trait perk combination on other pulse rifles but it is very nice to help keep your fireteam's health topped up, while you're incinerating crowds of minor spec adds while synergising with your solar subcalss fragments.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly for void subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. You can find the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds on a few different weapons - you could argue that it's better on auto-rifles like Ros Arago or Age-Old Bond - but the combination of an overshield and volatile enemies in CQC is definitely a fun one, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with arc subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick - you'll likely need to run some ammo reserve mods. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy?

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance (or maybe even in addition to). The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber (physics be damned) after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Uzume RR4 has very nice stats in it's subfamily, but the 50 zoom is either a blessing or a curse, depending on your viewpoint. Either way this is only worth keeping if you don't have a decent solar sniper, or it's better than the one you're replacing. The recoil direction of 75 is vertical, but if you're firing repeatedly at a crit spot it's still a good idea to control it with a boost to recoil direction or additional stability from your barrel perk. Handling is always nice to have too. Appended Mag gets you an extra shot - you can also use Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell to boost reload speed as your mag perk instead. In the first trait column as the support park, Fourth Time's The Charm or Clown Cartridge are pretty much tied - if you can reliably hit crits, FttC might get you an extra shot more reliably before reloading.

For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%.

Unfortunately, Retrofuturist is distinctly meh, so it's only worth hanging onto a roll if it fills a hole in your vault, and even then you'll have to reset your Crucible rank a few times to stand a decent chance of the roll you're after. As a Lightweight shotgun, you do get the +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed and, for some reason, it has a base mags size of 7, but that's where the praise ends. If you're hanging onto one, try a barrel perk that adds Handling, although a bit of range and stability doesn't hurt either.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Lethal Abundance has decent stats, but as a High-Impact frame auto rifle this isn't going to be on too many people's wish list. as a subfamily, they generally have poor handling and reload speed, so that's what to boost in the barrel and mag perk slots. For Strand synergy, Slice and Hatchling in the two trait columns give you the two perks to work with using your aspects and fragments. Slice also makes this a good swap weapon in a Bait and Switch rotation, applying 40% reduction in damage output from affected targets when procced after using your class ability.

Breakneck is back, and has very solid stats, although it looks like we're never going to see the OG (and OP) Rampage/ Onslaught version again. As a precision frame AR, you don't need to worry about recoil direction, so if you want a variation on the curated version, you might prefer Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling as your barrel park, but Extended Magazine or Appended Magazine are definitely the top two options for the magazine. For your general content add-clearing, the combination of Subsistence and Onslaught in the first and second trait columns should minimise your need to reloads while you're working your way through crowds of adds.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence (which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking) is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo (so 247 in reserve) with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges (8) as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS, but you might want to keep one just in case, if you don't have a slug shotty already. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. If you're looking for a backup DPS weapon, then a reloading perk in the first trait column - Fourth Time's The Charm, Reconstruction, Threat Detector, or Lead From Gold for you ammo economy are all possible. For a damage boosting perk in the second trait slot, choose between Surrounded, if you're likely to be in CQC with extra adds, or Vorpal Weapon for a reliable 15% boost to damage against Majors and Bosses. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot (Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds) will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best (maybe only) trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a void subclass. The reprised Vouchsafe has returned with a plethora of PvE possibilities. You get the +20 Mobility from the Lightweight Frame, which is always great but on the downside you also have low Stability and Handling (not such a problem with the origin trait) and abysmal Recoil Direction. You can handle the wonky recoil with a combination of recoil and/or stability perks in the barrel and mag slots.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills (and up to 21 if you reproc), together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit.

If this is your first season playing destiny either as a new light or a returning player, Imperative has one great redeeming factor; damage. Imperative belongs to the high-impact archetype of scouts giving it the slowest firing rate but the highest damage. Pairing that with more damage through Adrenaline Junkie, some AoE damage through Kinetic Tremors or Explosive Payload. All of these will be happily paired with Rapid Hit for the bonuses to the low stability and reload speed. Subsistence and Keep Away both mitigate the low reload speed by bypassing reload entirely or speeding it up, respectively.

As with most PvE bows you’re looking for a good combination of draw time and accuracy.

Explosive Head can stagger those arrow sponges a bit easier but having Rapid Hit or Archer’s Tempo there would have been preferred.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Precision frame hand cannons have not had their time in the spotlight for a while. Outside of the Seventh Seraph Officer’s Revolver paired with Lucky Pants there are not many reasons to use a precision frame hand cannon. If you run void subclasses a lot you can take advantage of Golden Tricorn to maximize damage, making these fast firing hand cannons feel way more chunky than they normally are. Rapid Hit will also bring up the already decent reload speed and their exceptional stability. If you feel like you need more range in PvE (which is an already odd thing to task for) you can opt for Keep Away for a continuous reload speed buff and a touch more range."

When Rampage and Outlaw were all we cared about. Things have shifted and more weapons are certainly popular. The only true competition Subjunctive needs to worry about is the Ikelos SMG. Both are arc, but what gives Subjunctive the edge? Golden Tricorn. It’s not the highest uptime on Arc but you can chain back to back arc ability kills with some loadouts, this will give Subjunctive a 1.5x damage bonus over the Ikelos (this is without giving the Ikelos a damage perk of its own). Most players spec’ed into Voltshot which will clear rooms easier but have slight difficulties taking down beefier targets. With Golden Tricorn 2x you’ll have enough damage to look at enemies and they’ll become unalive from sheer admiration, and you’ll be able to chunk down majors with ease, Subsistence just keeps the chains rolling."

So Bungie is either testing us to see if they should buff caster frames or trying to get more hands on feedback. I feel like caster frames are a tough one to balance. Give them too much damage and they become an extremely safe pick in everyday play. Lower the ammo requirements and you will inadvertently buff their DPS as you’ll have more opportunities to use the heavy attack. Lower their charge time to counterbalance either of those changes and we’re back to square one.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content.

As the first trait column support perk, Perpetual Motion adds further stat bonuses just for moving, or Unrelenting's bonus health is useful in CQC, while in the second column as the signature perk, Frenzy boosts the handling and reload speed up to 100 and adds 15% bonus damage when procced. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

//notes: Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec) with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Grab Glacioclasm while you can - unusually, for a world-drop weapon it has great stats as a High-Impact fusion rifle. Only firing five bolts, it's a bit more controllable than faster-firing subtypes, so spec into range with the barrel perk. In the battery perk slot, you're aiming to get as many shots as possible, with Ionized or Extended Battery. For the first trait perk, there's really only one to consider, and that's Overflow to instantly double your battery size for picking up ammo. Combine that with Controlled Burst in the second trait slot for DPS that'll hold up as a burst damage weapon against Majors or a backup weapon for boss damage phases. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for chunkier add-clearing against Minor Spec Enemies in general content with a solar subclass. The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness. If you already have a decent solar LMG, then you can pass. If you don't, Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For single target damage it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for boss damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. For burst damage, Relentless Strikes returns ammo on every third hit and Surrounded boosts damage by 35% if there are enemies nearby - this can be useful in crowded boss fights.

First-choice PvE pick for Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception - having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag as Appended and Extended Mag. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively while, if you don't have a good backup sniper for boss damage when you run out of heavy ammo, Precision Instrument boosts your damage output by 25% after six shots, for the rest of the 14-round magazine.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s (or 15s with Thread of Continuity), which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't.

The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling (particularly with Thread of Evolution) help with add clearing in the second.

Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist. Both origin traits are more PvP-orientated, but Nadir Focus's extra range and accuracy for free is a nice little bonus.

Get your blast radius as high as possible with your barrel and mag perks, so you can catch as many adds as possible with your shots. In the first trait column as the support perk, new to season 22 Loose Change boosts reload speed by 50 when you apply an elemental debuff, which is just what Destabilizing Rounds in the second column as the signature perk does. You should be able to clear crowded rooms fast and soften up beefier enemies. The Nadir Focus origin trait boosts your shot velocity further, which is a nice little bonus.

In the past, that's been the likes of Incandescent, but this has the potential to help with chunkier mobs you wouldn't usually want to use a primary against. Kill a thrall, freeze everything around it, explode the world. Demolitionist will feed your grenades, and that means even more freezing when on stasis, but don't for a moment think that means it can only be used on that subclass.

High Impact Auto-Rifles aren't really first choice for PvE - they do have good range, and the frame intrinsic provides more accuracy when stationary or slow-moving, but Abyss Defiant has great stats and trait combinations, so may be worth a try. Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell offers the biggest boost to reload speed. The fun solar combination when you're not too underlevelled is the new-to-season-22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk, for a burst of Cure for you and anyone nearby when reloading after a kill, and Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk for add control and working with the scorth and ignite verbs.

First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window (think Caretaker or Golgoroth), but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber (Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better). The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 (which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags). Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload (unless you pickup another ammo brick). Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. If you're looking for an arc shotgun, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases (for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say). As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots (don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later), or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts.

First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name's a bit confusing - Psi (Ψ) is the 23rd letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Hermetic can mean something that's occult or mysterious and difficult to understand, relating to the legendary alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, tightly sealed, immune to external influence, or solitary like a hermit, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Geodetic (which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth) is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords (excluding Bequest) and +27 Charge Rate (again, excepting Bequest). If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. For M+KB, focus on range with your barrel and mag perks - stability is less useful and you can use trait perks to help boost handling and reload speed. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's rare to get double damage perks outside of raid weapons, but Gutshot Straight in the first trait column boosts bodyshot damage by a further 10% - with a spray and pray weapon like an SMG, this could be the unique perk combination to chase. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

// Luna Regolith III (PvE first-choice roll)

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle (in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass), you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently (as at v7.2.0.3) weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there (although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total). In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks (Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds) will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage (and maxed handling and reload speed) with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line.

Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds.

// (Elastic String, Polymer String, Flexible String), (Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching), (Archer's Tempo, Shoot to Loot), Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5) with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and add clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The literal translation means "Before Astyanax". Astyanax (“Lord of the City”), in Greek legend, is the Trojans' popular nickname for the son of the city's greatest warrior, Prince Hector of Troy, and his wife Andromache. If you haven't got a well-rolled solar Precision bow, this is your chance - the stats are poor, but there are still decent trait combos to chase. If you do, then you can happily pass this by. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Archer's Tempo is the usual reliable choice as the support perk to speed up draw time. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Incandescent provides the solar synergy and helps with crowd control for minor adds. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting (Minor or Taken Spec) mod.|tags: PvE, PvE-MinorSpec, PvE-God, PvE-EndGame, M+KB, Controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage.

In the first trait column, as the support perk, Enlightened Action will boost both handling and reload speed just for hits (so you'll get two stacks per burst), or Perpetual Motion will provide smaller bumps to stats. In the second column as the signature perk, Vorpal Weapon, particularly in combination with Lucky Pants for Hunters, can do some decent damage against Majors, but mostly for Champions, when a seasonal mod is in play - with the two shots, this should be particularly good against overloads.

Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

Eleatic has access to Golden Tricorn which is the best damage perk in the game, or if you prefer not to use an arc subclass you could go with Target Lock for a slightly different Retrofit.

The only other synergy you could have asked for is Grave Robber for instant refresh on melee kills. However, on bigger bosses that might need a few more hits than your magazine allows this could slot in perfectly. Being Arc it also has some synergy with the Hunter class and can play into blinding / amplified builds. Discord is another interesting shout as you can run around with Frenzy for full uptime on damage and always having ammo to shoot with.

If you're constantly cycling debuffs it could be interesting, but not all subclasses have equal access to debuffs. Void warlock and hunter could be the strongest uptime with child and the smoke bomb applying debuffs. Otherwise I think this perk is mostly useless. It then leaves us with a dilemma; what is the best PvE perk on Kept Confidence for PvE? Stats for All is probably going to be your best bet. It leaves a lot to be desired, but is the best we can do.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Nightshade returns in its third, and hopefully, final glory. With a recoil direction of 56 you almost need Arrowhead Brake in order to fire at full RPM. In PvE I would highly recommend Flared Magwell or Light Mag depending on if you want range or stability. The added reload will feel incredible. You can then stack on Outlaw or Enlightened Action for better reload on top of that, or even Keep Away to bump out your range and handling. I find that in certain activities it is hard to keep enemies away all the time so you'll be constantly fighting whether the perk is up or not. Finally to round out the reload / damage perks you can use the easiest damage Nightshade has to offer, Collective Action. I find Kill Clip to be better as it's an ever so slightly higher damage bump. But depending on your build if you can create those elemental pickups it would be easier on Collective Action. Hatchling could work really well on Strand now that they received a slight buff."

I know I will be using it but that's because it can roll with an ever so elusive combination of Grave Robber and Swashbuckler. The Showrunner being the second lightweight frame with this combo and the first in the Kinetic Slot. For me this works well with all my titan builds and my titan brain. However, if you're not on a punch subclass or the master class then opting for something like Overflow and Kinetic Tremors will be a great combo. Overflow allows you to get 72 bullets per magazine, allowing for a whopping 7 Kinetic Tremor activations; and that's just at base. The only other weapon to get this combination is Buzzard but the lower magazine on Buzzard really holds it back, only getting 3 per overflow. This doesn't mean you can't get more than that by constantly walking over bricks to refill the magazine, but let's be honest I haven't done that subconsciously and I love Overflow."

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5) with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Shapeable. Kept Confidence drops into a very competitive slot, and against kinetic slot stat monsters like Fatebringer, Austringer and Eyasluna it doesn't fare well. The trait options look a bit more aimed at PvP too. If you're looking to craft a PvE version, round out the stats a little with either Smallbore or Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk, and Tactical Mag in the magazine. In the trait columns, the new to Season 22 Loose Change perk will boost reload to 100 when procced by applying an elemental debuff, can be paired with the extendable 7s of 20% damage boost from Collective Action when you collect an elemental pickup - working particularly well with Strand Tangles thrown at an enemy. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Shoot to Loot is really useful in end-game activities - both safely collecting ammo bricks and reloading all your weapons at the same time. This pairs well with Explosive Payload as the signature trait which both adds free damage against enemies, and extends the ammo pickup range of Shoot to Loot. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus (Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking") has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool. If you haven't got one, then Arrowhead Brake improves handling and recoil direction, and Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum mag size of 5, and adds stability and reload speed. Overflow pushes you to an almost comical 11 in the mag on an ammo pickup, and Fighting Line boosts precision damage by 20% when you're close to at least two fireteam members - ideal for sustained damage phases against slow-moving or Divinity-debuffed bosses.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite (named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit), is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss.

First-choice PvE pick sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies, or burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings (think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code). While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage (it all helps!). For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Enhanced Explosive Light as the second column signature perk gives you 7 rockets with a 25% damage boost for the low, low costs of just picking up orbs - good for both burst and sustained damage.

Rapid-fire snipers aren’t meta but this one could be incredibly strong to keep within your vault. Collective Action is an incredibly useful buff as it can be applied on any subclass. Headstone gives you some great cover and add control, but I find it far less useful on a sniper. Triple Tap gives you some great utility against majors, bosses, or vehicles where you can continuously crit them.

Bait and Switch is another great damage perk and does more damage, but I find Explosive Light easier to work with, especially with the new mod system revolving around orbs of power.

I didn’t love its original form, so let’s see if this is the redemption arc of the century. In PvE you might enjoy a 100 recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the best call. All 900 RPM SMGs are bullet hoses, so I think that increasing the mag size is the best way to go. You could also completely circumvent reload through Subsistence. Another alternative is just bumping up your reload so the downtime between mags is reduced. Flared Magwell coupled with either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion will bring down your reload speed from 1.86s to either 1.32s with TD2x or 1.47s with PM2x. The easiest damage bonus is Collective Action this season as it neutrally pairs with every subclass. Incandescent works better on Solar builds but can neutrally clear rooms." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

From a niche but underwhelming raid weapon to arguably the best in its archetype. Arrowhead Brake will bring up that low recoil direction, and Rapid Hit will bring up the low stability and reload speed. Kinetic Tremors is what brings up Chattering Bone’s utility. You could opt for sheer damage through Kill Clip and Focused Fury but I don’t know if the two of those perks would work together.

"Different Times needs Arrowhead Brake to compete even as a pulse rifle. Having the second lowest recoil direction at 52 is underwhelming. Jurassic Green is lower but ends better at 50. With Arrowhead Brake and a CB mod you’ll sit at 97 recoil direction. Subsistence will help you keep shooting at low tier activities, and Outlaw will have a slightly higher utility, but is far worse than Rapid Hit. Collective Action is the flavor of the season, but might catch a small nerf soon. Golden Tricorn is my next favorite perk but falls off with Strand not being able to reliably kill with every single ability.

Well-Rounded does give some great stability to bring up Rapacious Appetite’s extremely low stability.

Focused Fury will give you some great damage to clear red bars and majors if you wanted to, but Spare Rations just isn’t good enough for higher tiered activities." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Targeted Redaction
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed. Aggressive Frame(120) Void Hand Cannon Primary Ammo.  "Targeted Redaction has a subpar perk pool. You can make this hand cannon work with Outlaw for faster reloads and your choice of fourth column perk. Collective Action gives you great damage without having to spec into any specific subclass. Destabilizing Rounds is fun with stacking void debuffs. Explosive Payload will help mitigate some damage fall off, which helps hand cannons in higher level activities, it also adds some outgoing flinch. I would probably take this perk last as other perks will be better overall, but it does help in PvE." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

I don’t say that often but given all the goodies of double damage perks, craftability, and great stats you can really have it your way. Rewind Rounds coupled with Collective Action for subclass agnostic buffs, Controlled Burst for laying down enemies or Golden Tricorn when on Arc will feel incredibly strong. Reconstruction is a tried and true gem of a perk, only beaten by my obsession with Overflow. Kill Clip can stack with all of these creating over 100% damage increases with Kill Clip, Golden Tricorn 2x, 3 Surge Mods, and Major Spec. If you set things up right you can almost have a 150% damage increase. Simply put it is the best fusion in the game for damage and has greater utility beyond that." |tags:pve,mkb,controller

In its current version you can certainly get some good mileage out of the updated perks, only if you can agree with the wonky sights. Archer’s Tempo will get you the best reload / knock time, and Golden Tricorn is simply the best damage perk in the game. On solar that job gets even easier with the plethora of amazing abilities.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% (doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up). Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. Fortunately, for mouse and keyboard, you can ignore the stability and just go for range with the barrel choice and masterwork. In the mag, the Combat Effect perks all provide utility, you can boost Reload Speed through Light Mag or Flared Magwell. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk or, alternatively you can extend the useful magazine through Fourth Time's The Charm. Then, in the second column as the signature perk, One For All is an easy-to-proc 35% boost to damage for add clear, or to take on the occasional major.

(??? 1840239774 1482024992 ???): First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general content. Shapeable. Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. The Recoil Direction is awful, so Arrowhead Brake is pretty much a must have in the barrel. Flared Magwell fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. In general, non-endgame content Outlaw and Subsistence are both great for weapon uptime in the first trait column as your signature perk while, in the second column as the signature perk, the first stack of Golden Tricorn is easy to proc for 15% bonus damage, even if the second stack is more difficult to proc with a Strand subclass.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. As at S21, A Distant Pull is the only non-raid kinetic rapid-fire sniper rifle. As you might expect, it comes with lower stats but it's still usable if you can fill the gaps. Fluted Barrel and Tactical Mag fill out Handling, Stability, Reload Speed and also max out the magazine size to 7. Overflow is laughably good on a special weapon, as a first trait column support park, doubling the magazine size just for picking up an ammo brick, even when stowed. Collective Action should be easy to proc for a 7 second 20% damage boost as your signature perk, which should be long enough for damage against a stunned Champion or Majors.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Until Its Return has decent stats in comparison to other kinetic slot rapid-fire shotguns and some reliable trait combinations. Handling is the best thing to aim for with the barrel perk, but range and stability can be useful too. Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 8 rounds, so there's no point looking at Appended or Extended Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow is great for doubling the mag size for running over an ammo brick, or Auto-Loading Holster means you can rely on a full magazine every time you pull it out. Surrounded in the second column as the signature perk boosts damage by 40% (+47% for the enhanced version). Alternatively, Trench Barrel boosts damage by 50% for three shots after a melee hit.

As with all swords, Jagged Edge is the usual choice for the blade for its increased damage. To pair with your traits, you'll want to go with heavy guard, mainly to slow your charge time. The play here is to use unpowered heavy attacks, which do a bit less damage but only cost 1 ammo, to proc Tireless Blade in the first trait column as the support perk and refund ammo for every other kill - if you're lucky you can return more ammo than you use. In the second column as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn's first stack will easily make up the reduced damage after the first kill, or Chain Reaction's AoE damage should mean you can wade into crowds of adds, while never running out of ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in end-game content. Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives.

Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently (v7.1.0.2, S21) take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use for grenadier builds in in general activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not (although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use).

First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy (it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow). The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Techeun Force (however Saint Kabr pronounces it...) is reprised in a new, highly desirable perk set. I say set, it's really just one perk in particular.

For a damage roll, Liquid Coils is the obvious choice - don't worry, we'll get around the charge time penalty later. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Rewind Rounds means you should be able to keep shooting until the battery is empty - you need a minimum of two shots in the mag to proc it, but then it reloads 2 shots from reserves.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage.

For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade (and the extra damage from the grenade as well).

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game activities. Loaded Question is back, and has some interesting new combinations. Being a high-impact fusion rifle, there are only five bolts, so stability is slightly less of an issue - Fluted Barrel adds useful handling, and Hammer-Forged Rifling or Smallbore add Range as the barrel perk. There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, will trigger Reservoir Burst in the second trait slot as the signature perk, a Chain Reaction-type explosions on kills to clear adds, and +25% damage to burst down Majors and maybe the occasional boss DPS phase. Plus you can build into the Arc 3.0 blinding and jolting verb kit with an arc subclass, making this a bit of a PvE Swiss-Army Knife.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities, particularly with a Strand subclass. While you've probably been melted a few times in PvP with The Immortal, it's still interesting in PvE as the first aggressive frame Strand SMG (the same subfamily as Ikelos).It's an absolute stat monster and the support perks can make it even more so, so we'll start with a range-boosting barrel, and any of the "Rounds" magazines. In the first trait column for the support perk, Threat Detector, Surplus (particularly easy to maintain with the extra melee charges from Strand), or Perpetual Motion will bump gunfeel stats up. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. In the second column, Hatchling is the natural choice to pair with a Strand subclass to generate Threadlings for add control.

Just to be a bit special? Yes. But also, Tactical Mag should bring the gun to a nice 16 mag size, which will play nicely with FTTC. The reload from Tac and MW will be more than enough and they don't have a kill condition, so personally I don't think I need outlaw.

I'm always excited to get a new weapon type to add to my toolbox, and this weapon immediately gives us the Outlaw/Hatchling combo I've been waiting for (I still love you Round Robin). I expect to have a lot of dumb fun with this gun in PVE, especially in activities with a Strand surge (AKA all of them this season). Warlocks in particular should enjoy this combo, especially with Thread of Evolution, the Classy Contender trait, and an Empowering rift. That being said, Threadlings aren't the strongest choice for endgame PVE, and Lightweight frame scouts aren't my favorite in GMs either, so I expect this will just be a roll for fun, rather than a top tier PVE weapon. If you are intent on using this for GMs, you'll want Explosive Payload or maybe even Focused Fury instead." Recommended MW: Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected (maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉). Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed (and an extra shot for Tac Mag). Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22) with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius (let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion), or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel.

Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast.

The choice of barrel matters significantly less for PvE and isn’t something to worry about. However, the go-to option is still Hammer-Forged.

// Briar's Contempt - Briar's Contempt (mnk,pve)
//notes: DPS is the best-suited job for Briar’s Contempt inside PvE. Fluted Barrel is still the best option due to the large increase in handling. This means a faster swapping speed which can be crucial to maximizing DPS. For the magazine, either Liquid Coils or Ionized Battery are the best choices. Liquid Coils grant an increase in impact, resulting in higher damage per shot. Ionized Battery adds an additional round to the magazine, which helps during longer DPS phases. The best perks in column 1 are Rewind Rounds, Demolionist, and Reconstruction. All three perks grant reloading effects/increase total magazine size, which removes/lowers the need to manually reload the gun. This is great for sustained damage. Frenzy and Focused Fury are the best column 2 perks due to the increase in damage that they provide. Surrounded can situationally be the best option, but the requirements to activate it can be difficult.|tags:mnk,pve

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles (as at v7.0.0.7, anyway) but they add a very useful +20 mobility (useful when buildcrafting) and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers (five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!). You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. Battle Scar is one of the first kinetic weapons that can roll with Kinetic Tremors as your signature perk in the second trait column - for end-game activities this pairs nicely with Shoot to Loot as, as well as the passive damage boost just for repeated hits you will also pick up ammo from anywhere in the shockwave area and reload all of your guns too.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper (although the range of stats is pretty compressed) - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin (named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore) is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon (named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking) is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

// Irukandji (PvE first-choice roll)
// (Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling), (Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell), (Envious Assassing, Fourth Time's The Charm, Rapid Hit), (Firing Line, Focused Fury)
//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 (https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL) with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji (a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be) does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds (you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty) should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability (and reload speed) as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C (named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking), a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach (named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland), a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. If you didn't pick up an Ammit with Incandescent from Witch Queen, this gives you access to a similar (if unenhanced) set of perks. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. To fill in the other gunfeel stats, Flared Magwell boosts Stability and Reload Speed, or Light Mag boosts Range and Reload Speed in the mag. As the support perk, in the first trait column, Feeding Frenzy boosts reload speed further after kills - your solar ignition kills from Incandescent will add to the stacks, particularly when paired with Ember of Ashes.

Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. This is one of the first ARs with Target Lock, so if you choose that as your second trait column signature perk to build towards, Alloy Mag makes a lot of sense as the magazine perk - you need to be firing continuously until the mag is empty to build damage stacks. Although generally more of a PvP perk, Zen Moment as the support perk helps with the lowish stability to keep shots on target for Target Lock's stacking damage boost.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling (and boost reload speed too). Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique (as at v7.0.0.6, anyway) on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s.

Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness (and Reload Speed), so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

//notes:Inspired by @DestinyMBP Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 (https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo) with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 (except DSC's Bequest), and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working (and Ember of Ashes helps) as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo.

// Raconteur - Raconteur (pve,mkb)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Unsurprisingly, the favorite here is still Archer's Tempo. [...] I don't think there's anything in the 1st column besides maybe Stats for All that I care about whatsoever. Maybe Wellspring. Shoot to Loot is definitely an option for you Master and GM content runners though, more of a specialty thing, not really needed for general content. In the second column, Explosive Head for that PvE damage bump is pretty solid, along with Headstone for any sort of Stasis builds that you might wanna be using if you are not using Ager's Scepter or Verglas Curve the new season 20 bow for whatever reasons. Are things like Rampage and Successful Warm-up also ok, of course they are, they are totally reasonable perks to use as well. But the roll I'm looking for here would be Archer's and Explosive, unless I'm running Stasis where I want Headstone. Go for some form of Arrow Shaft and Tactile or Agile string, draw time masterwork is fine."|tags:pve,mkb

// Regnant - Regnant (mkb,pve)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "First column, Auto-Loading or Envious Assassin are the top choices, but for different reasons. You want Auto for any sort of weapon swap meta or in stuff where you want the convenience of an auto reload, you want Envious for times where you need the ability to lay into something with as many grenades as humanly possible. It varies from activity to activity in terms of what you actually want or need though. Second column, the choice is quite clear: Explosive Light. Orbs drive one of the main engines of buildcrafting right now and therefore, orbs of power should basically be everywhere, which means you might as well just be getting a near permanent damage bonus to your GL. The only other thing I'm considering is Destabilizing Rounds, which is purple Incandescent more or less, but I am STILL not sold on the perk just yet, not until I try out some void build stuff in the future. Spike Grenade is a good choice provided you're hitting targets directly with grenades, but most other things aren't too great, and then we'd like some sort of Blast Radius increase, with the Masterwork being up to you for the most part. Handling is good for both Auto-Loading and Envious, velocity is fine, blast radius is fine, probably not reload though."|tags:mkb,pve

// Prodigal Return - Prodigal Return (mkb,pve)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Gonna be tough to beat out Salvager's Salvo [...] I think a lot of people are gonna see Envious and Voltshot and will just call it a day, I dunno about that though. If you do wanna go with Envious, then I would say Voltshot has a bit of negative synergy. Voltshot asks you to reload a lot,but the whole point of Envious is to sort of use it like an auto-loading holster type perk. I'd probably pick something else like Demolitionist, even if Demo only gets 10% energy per kill on special GLs. Lead From Gold is also not too bad of an idea here to keep ammo counts high. If you DO want Voltshot, then I'd want stuff that increases reload speed to just lay out as many grenades as possible, even going as far as going Field Prep if you remember to crouch, although Field Prep is not the most condusive perk if you use a GL like I do, which is a lot of jumping up and down. Even Threat Detector, lot of content out there now that has you surrounded by enemies. Definitely gotta take blinding err, disorienting grenades they're called now, something like disorient/envious/demo works quite well. If you want Voltshot, focus on reload speed. LoI don't think you need Spike nades here, this isn't a power GL."|tags:mkb,pve

// Perpetualis - Perpetualis (pve,mkb)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Obviously the main appeal here is Hatchling for any sort of Strand based builds, although I'd argue that Hatchling is more important on Warlock than Titan or Hunter. [...] Envious Assassin seems very appealing. Loads more ammo into the gun, but you gotta get some kills with other weapons and they gotta be rapid kills. If you're using a machine gun, it's a good perk on a different gun, like this one, but I don't think it's the instalock perk that some people may think it is. It's good though. Keep Away is another solid option, but I think it kinda depends on the content. You're using an auto-rifle, you do need to be SOMEWHAT close to things and that might prevent this perk from activating. Elemental Capacitor, ehh, not for strand in my opinion, for PvE anyway. I guess I'm probably going Envious still, the rest of the roster is eh. Second column, Hatchling if you're doing a Threadling build, but if you're not, it's not like it's the worst choice you can possibly make and I think a lot of people are gonna go for it anyway. Target Lock I'm not sold on unless you're doing higher level content where things aren't gonna die as quickly. I would say don't sleep on Golden Tricorn because Strand can proc Golden Tricorn x2 REALLY easily and that's a very significant damage boost that can have a lot of up time. Demolitionist is also not too bad of an idea, but if I'm getting Demo, then I'm gonna use the raid auto, which feels like a laser beam. Go for Arrowhead Brake, Accurized and Range masterwork."|tags:pve,mkb

// Royal Executioner - Royal Executioner (mkb,pve)
//notes: Datto (PvE, MKB): "Something that looks quite appealing is Envious Assassin and Reservoir Burst. You overflow the magazine, you're getting bonus burst shots, what's not to love about that? And Envious makes a bit more sense on this gun vs. a primary weapon because the primary weapon is the thing you'll be using the most, at least in theory anyway. Or you're using a machine gun, but the concept is the same. The only other thing I'd want is maybe trying out Incandescent instead of Reservoir Burst for some scorch plays, killing two enemies at a time can spread scorch quite quickly. If you wanna do some PvP, Firmly Planted is the way to go in the first column. Arrowhead Brake, Accelerated Coils or Enhanced Battery and masterwork... reload speed probably."|tags:mkb,pve

Second column, Valiant Charge is leading the way right now and beyond the Eager Edgelords trying out some new tech, I'm not exactly sure the viability of this outside of the movement tech world. Pretty much everything else that you can get on this thing is definitely viable in some form. Assassin's Blade, more damage after kill, Incandescent, it's Incandescent and on a sword, it's probably gonna treat you pretty well. Surrounded, more damage, One for All, more damage, I love One for All in general. If I'm making this thing, I'm just going like Relentless Strikes and One for All or something because I don't guard with swords, I go unga bunga with swords, just swipe swipe swipe until they die or I die.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Shapeable. Our first Strand Hand Cannon. Middling stats by comparison with other Aggressive Frames - prioritise handling and stability with your barrel and mag to improve gunfeel. You should be engaging enemies at a decent range so Keep Away boosts range, accuracy and reload speed, or Subsistence will keep your mag topped up. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on crit kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Precision frame SMG, so you don't have to worry about recoil direction and range is pretty compressed, so go for handling and stability with your barrel. In the mag, High-Caliber Rounds is always good for extra flinch on a bullet hose, but Armor-Piercing is also decent for damaging multiple adds in CQC, Ricochet Rounds can be run or just get extra stability and Reload speed with Flared Magwell. There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column - Envious Assassin is much better on a Special or Power weapon, but it's worth it for the occasional overfilled mag. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on rapid kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats (so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time). Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The first Strand flavoured LMG as at v7.0.0.3 but unfortunately stats are low by comparison with other adaptive frames - but there's still a choice of very usable rolls. Chambered Compensator takes the recoil direction to a controllable 90 and adds some extra stability. If you're using this for add clear, any one of the combat effect rounds (High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing or Ricochet Rounds) will work in the mag, then a reload park like Feeding Frenzy, maybe Keep Away if you're not up to your neck in CQC adds, Pulse Monitor to refill the magazine when your shield's broken, or Envious Assassin to overfill the magazine before you start, should work nicely. In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

//Round Robin
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Round Robin is a strand, 120 RPM hand cannon. We have a lot of new perks with Lightfall and arguably one of the top rolls on this gun consists of 2 new perks: Keep Away and Hatchling. Keep Away is the opposite of Threat Detector, you get bonus stats when there is NOTHING near you, minus allies. Hatchling is where precision final blows or rapid non-precision kills spawn a Threadling at the target's location. In the first column, we have soem good stuff, Keep Away, Subsistence and Envious Assassin, another good perk, where rapidly killing targets with other guns will transfer ammo into this gun from reserves and this can overflow the magazine. At the moment, I feel like this is much more of a special weapon type perk, but I wouldn't begrudge you for using it as we feel it out. The second column has Hatchling, Kill Clip and Golden Tricorn. Golden Tricorn is definitely a bit better of a pick now thanks to 3.0 subclasses and the general up time you can have on grenades and melees nowadays. I think Hatchling is quite popular right now because it's new and it links up with Strand and there are Strand fragments to buff Threadlings, so if it fits with your build, it is certainly worth a try. Threadlings WILL proc Golden Tricorn if they are from Threadling Grenade. This gun just kicks pretty hard, it's a 120 so that makes sense, so I'm gonna be going with stability based minor perks and masterwork. I have heard good things about this gun in PvP with Keep Away and Kill Clip, but I have not tested it myself just yet. Again, it does kick pretty hard. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=43s

//Volta Bracket
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Volta Bracket is a Strand Sniper, 72 RPM so a slower one, gonna be lower DPS, but higher total damage on average. I think the only PvE roll here is for the sniper copium addicts and that is Triple Tap or Envious Assassin and Firing Line. Pretty much any other option on this gun is for specialty use only. If you wanna use Hatchling for some sort of a build, cool, but snipers haven't received any significant changes and are still not very popular picks for most of PvE right now. Looking at range based perks or magazine based perks if used for single target damage purposes. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=150s

//Phyllotactic Spiral
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Phyllotactic Spiral is an arc energy pulse, 340 RPM. This thing feels like it can get some pretty decent rolls, but I think Voltshot for PvE is just too nice to pass up. If you're going Voltshot in the second column, I'm gonna call an audible for lower end PvE content and go with Compulsive Reloader, since I feel like the goal with Voltshot is either hitting a big target with jolt and tagging a bunch of stuff around it with the AoE portion, which would make CR not good, or just mowing through little dinker enemies and constantly proccing it over and over. If you're doing the second thing, I'd try out Compulsive. In higher end content, I'm probably looking at Keep Away, maybe Tunnel Vision, but I don't think that's super important in PvE. Kill Clip and Frenzy are also on this thing, but I think Voltshot is just too good. I'm looking at range or reload speed for masterwork and then your choice of either magazine or range minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=192s

//Iterative Loop
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Iterative Loop is an arc fusion rifle, rapid-fire frame, so 500 charge time. This is the first time I think we've seen a fusion with Voltshot, but honestly, besides Demolitionist, I'm not too thrilled with many of the other second column perks anyway, so we're probably going Voltshot regardless. In the first column, we got options, Lead From Gold, Killing Wind, but again, I'm calling an audible in Compulsive Reloader. You want to proc Voltshot a LOT on guns with Voltshot and fusion are pretty good at killing stuff in the top half of the magazine. But, I can understand if you wanna roll with something else. Reload masterwork as well, with Accelerated Coils or Enhanced Battery and probably Arrowhead Brake for recoil control. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=253s

//Dimensional Hypotrochoid
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Dimensional Hypotrochoid is the first wave frame grenade launcher in the heavy slot, it is stasis based. First column, Envious Assassin seems like a really easy pick given you're probably not gonna be doing most of your killing with this gun, but Stats for All isn't too bad of a pick either, along with Field Prep, even Unrelenting isn't the worst thing here, you have a lot of options, but I'm personally gonna take Envious Assassin. Second column, we have Chain Reaction, a big favorite and a good perk, One for All and... that's really about it for me, I'm not a huge fan of Vorpal anymore now that it's only 10% on bosses for power weapons. I dunno if I'm the hugest fan of this gun just yet in general though, I feel like special waveframe GLs are kinda getting the job done. Blast Radius is good for your minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=297s

// Synchronic Roulette
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Synchronic Roulette. This is a Strand SMG, 600 RPM, so slower firing and wouldn't you know it, it too has Hatchling as a perk and I'm pretty sure that is the overwhelming favorite right now. In the first column, we have some decent options, Envious Assassin, Keep Away, Pulse Monitor, I might skew towards Pulse Monitor or Under Pressure. Again, Envious on a primary I'm not completely sold on, but it's not like it's a BAD option or anything like that. This might be more of a "pick what you like," kind of option, except for Slickdraw, don't pick that. Pugilist in the second column is also somewhat of an option for those of you with Strand builds as they can to be pretty melee focused. We're looking for range in our minor perks, little Arrowhead Brake again and either range or stability depending on your preference. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=353s

// Basso Ostinato
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Basso Ostinato, a void shotgun, 140 RPM, rapid fire. Shotguns in PvE world are a bit weird, not really super popular at the moment, but I feel like with the difficulty increases, they're going to be a better mid-tier difficulty weapon class, stuff that's around -10, -15. In any case, This gun has 3 premier perks in the second column, One Two Punch, Trench Barrel, and new with Lightfall, Destabilizing Rounds, where final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile. Anything with the word Volatile immediately is gonna perk some ears up and this is definitely the most popular perk on this gun at the moment for you void enjoyers out there. That being said, after running with this gun and this perk for a little bit, I wasn't exactly the most impressive, but I also wasn't optimized for its use pretty much at all, so there's probably some more investigating to be done. However, I'm skeptical. In the first column, Envious Assassin isn't a bad choice at all, Lead from Gold also getting a lot of love here, although I dunno if it's my favorite. Don't sleep on Grave Robber either, you're gonna be in melee range with this thing anyway so might as well get some free reloads. I think One-Two Punch is probably better on a harder hitting shotty, the faster ones feel like a more trigger happy kinda gun. You can certainly make arguments for both rapid fire and high impact shotguns in terms of 1-2 Punch viability. I think most people are gonna hunt Destabilizing Rounds to try them out while the perk is still new though, but if it ends up not being good, then 1-2 Punch or Trench Barrel. Magazine perks and range are good for your minor perks. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=412s

// Circular Logic
//notes: Datto's Thoughts, Circular Logic, a strand machine gun, 450 RPM, which is pretty good. Why don't you take a guess as to what the most popular perk is here? If you said Hatchling, you'd be right. People wanting to experiment with Threadlings and consider how quickly you'll be able to mow down targets with a machine gun, I totally get the appeal. Fortunately the perks in the first column make things pretty simple: Feeding Frenzy, Envious Assassin and Keep Away are all good choices, but I'm probably leaning towards Feeding Frenzy or Envious Assassin. I'd say FF because I'm imagining the way that I would use this gun, which is basically as a primary weapon thanks to the reserves buff that machine guns got, and thus would never get to proc Envious Assassin in the first place. Target Lock is technically also an option thanks to the origin trait on these guns, but this perk turns the gun into more of a single target boss damage weapon vs. an add clear weapon. Interesting idea if you're looking for something to fit that niche. pve. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlV7QZ5P0Mk&t=525s

// Lodbrok-C
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "High-impact frame autos feel weird. They shoot too slow for my liking but their damage is incredible. They can chew through rank-and-file enemies with ease, but their low magazine size handicaps them. The best thing to do is try and work around the low magazine by bumping it up or bypassing it entirely. Doing both with appended mag and demolitionist might give you the best bang for your buck. Add on adrenaline junkie for the damage boost and you have a pretty solid weapon. Osmosis will help with elemental wells and general subclass synergy. Cascade point and target lock are interesting. I think on a high-damage primary like Lodbrok-C either could work really well. Cascade point will increase your RPM and target lock will increase your damage.

// Disparity
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Disparity is probably the best weapon to come out of the season. A craftable aggressive burst pulse rifle that looks good, feels good, has a fantastic sight [...]. There are so many great perks to go for but the base will all be the same. Arrowhead to have near-perfect recoil direction. Flared magwell or tactical mag for a bump in reload / stability with the latter having a slight bump in magazine. Rapid hit is my preferred third column option but outlaw is easier and immediate. No need to build up stacks, just headshot and done. Frenzy is the immediate choice for a “no thoughts, head empty” workhorse weapon. Headstone and desperado are both fantastic for their respective builds. The former gives you slow, cover, and stasis synergy, while the latter gives you that Rambo effect turning your pulse into a mini machine gun." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

In PvE the best shotguns are pin-point frames for damage, and dealer’s choice for general use.

The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler.

// Retrofit Escapade
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I dislike 900 rpm machine guns. They don’t feel very strong for how fast they fire. If I had some good Rambo moments where I could shred hordes of low-tier adds without having to recoil control that much I would love it. But having the lowest base stats across the machine gun archetypes and the fastest rpm makes them unwieldy. Arrowhead brake will bring up the terribly low recoil direction and having more in the magazine means you can be off target for 0.001s and not waste half your ammo. Feeding frenzy and field prep are both ways to bump up the decent reload speed. Golden tricorn will get you the best bang for your glimmer when paired with a void subclass. All void subclasses are viable in end game content so that’s not an issue. Frenzy is best when not on a void subclass and vorpal will allow you to do increased but not substantial damage in and out of combat." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

The synergy is there and it makes for a really fun game play cycle. Subsistence and trench barrel are good options together, as are pugilist and swashbuckler.

The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work.

Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks.

// Veles-X
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Veles-X is an aggressive burst pulse rifle that doesn’t need a raid to acquire. [...] If you happen to use void, however, getting golden tricorn 2x should be a cakewalk. The synergy is there to take this gun with echo of instability. Get a kill with Veles-X first, throw a grenade and get volatile rounds. You have golden tricorn 2x, this can stack with font of might for insane damage output. You have volatile rounds for add clear and if you get the kill you’ll have a small overshield to use. This is incredible for almost all activities. Unless you can’t get the grenade kill easily I would keep this in your inventory." Recommended MW - Stability.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Albruna-D
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "For any PvE activity I will always try and prioritize recoil direction. Especially on special weapons or your main DPS weapon to make follow up shots easier. Any mag boosting perk will make the overall roll better. The usual suspects of triple tap, clown cartridge and field prep all make their appearance. Alongside our usual damage perks; firing line, frenzy and vorpal weapon. All of these damage perks are phenomenal, but use case specific. Firing line only works when in a full fireteam or raid, and you’d have to be within range for it to work. Frenzy only really works as long as you’re continuously taking damage or dealing it. Vorpal is the easiest to work with but also has the lowest damage output of all three."

// Prolonged Engagement
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This submachine gun is incredible. Decent base stats, good base recoil direction, a million and a half perks. What could be better? Despite not having perfect recoil I would still try and hit 100 with arrowhead brake. Flared magwell or appended is dealer’s choice. I find with reload gauntlets or the plethora of ways to bypass reload are more than enough for me. Subsistence is one such way. Being able to ignore a whole stat on your weapon means you can invest those stat points into any other stat. You will still need to reload eventually and having a good reload stat will make that feel less like a slow molasses river. Finally there’s your damage perks. Frenzy is tried and true, and headstone is just a wonderful add clear perk. Multikill clip is best used with a dedicated reload perk like feeding frenzy or outlaw."

Veist Stinger is the origin trait to use, as it procs per shot rather than per burst, which means you'll probably never need to reload. F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser. Being a stasis LFR, it's easy to get a Font of Might 25% boost to your damage if you have a Warlock putting down a Well and willing to use the Supreme Wellmaker mod, and you're using the Elemental Shards and Elemental Time Dilation mods. You'll need to keep your shots on a boss's crit spot, so maximise your stability with your barrel, and then add in an extra charge with no downsides with Enhanced Battery. For major or boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves (which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger). Frenzy is an easily procced 15% damage boost just for being in combat, or Vorpal Weapon is an uncomplicated 10% boost against Majors and Bosses.

There are no real holes in the stats, but Fluted Barrel or Smallbore provide nice boosts in the barrel. In the battery, Particle Repeater helps keep the burst tight, or if you're a little impatient, Accelerated Coils reduces charge time.

// Cold Front
//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Abysmal stability means this thing will kick like a mule and being under the 20 stability threshold means you’ll be taking extra flinch. So the priority with this weapon is to improve stability (and any other stats) as soon as possible. Enter the community-named “musketeer” build (Stats and One for All). With a quick pass over 3 targets, you’ll gain stats boosts and damage. Tac Mag may not be the most stat heavy option, but the extra bullet may help in securing that initial activation. Other stat raising perks can work, but don’t keep any rolls without ‘em.

// Stay Frosty
//notes:/u/SirStallion_ (PvE / M+KB / Controller): Let me address the elephant in the gun, "Thresh". Thresh is not often seen as a top tier perk, but that's because it's typically fighting for 4th slot against damage perks or better utility perks. In this case however, it's a 3rd slot pick which means you can use it in tandem with the better utility perk, "Headstone". Assuming the headstone explosions trigger Thresh in much the same way it does Stats for All and Unrelenting, it should make for some decent super gains for your stasis builds.

Similar thought process to Glacioclasm, kill stuff with big explosions (or in this case, Scorch) and refill the mag automatically. All reserves, no reload, but Flared Magwell just in case you get hit with a heaping spoonful of "Destiny" and things don't go to plan. Plus, the extra stability is nice.

// Planck's Stride - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Planck's Stride is a unique LMG. Typically, I aim for strong stability, and ways to force a reload to make LMGs viable, as no one wants to spend 5 full seconds reloading mid-combat. Planck's doesn't really have that outside of Grave Robber, which means using an LMG for CQC engagements to get the most out of its perk pool. I can see it working with ranged melees, like with Warlock's Celestial Fire - a synergistic Karnstein, Grave Robber / Pugilist build could be fun. Ultimately, there's a few interesting options here for build-crafters, but not a lot to help it win out against better LMGs." tags:pve|tags:pve

You'll know which people have actually used the gun by the recommendations / rolls they're chasing. The base recoil direction and stability combo is bad. It kicks, 50RD is inconsistent at best, and sabotaging your play at worst. But -- if you get Heating Up, it completely fixes this, and allows you to make use of the utterly fantastic fourth column perks without reprieve.

// Qullim's Terminus - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

It's one of the privileged few to have Demolitionist in the third column, meaning you have access to Demo/Swashbuckler (for synergy with the Right Hook origin trait), Demo/Voltshot if you want the long-range jolting capability, and also Dragonfly which I'll never not recommend based on fun factor alone.

// Qullim's Terminus (Harrowed) - [YeezyGT's S18]  (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Qullim's Terminus wins the arms race on style points alone. Where it struggles is a slow Reload with little in the perk pool that can effectively mitigate this. Firefly and Ensemble can do some heavy lifting here - and Stats for All is beneficial for Reload once again, though even 100 Reload on an LMG pails in comparison to options like Demolitionist, Reconstruction, Auto-Loading Holster that don't ruin the flow of combat. My recommendation for Qullim's as a result is unfortunately tied to builds that have the ability to force a reload, using this LMG as a "glass cannon" style, investing into Heating Up / Killing Tally to benefit from recoil and stability boosts, and completely clear a room before needing to initiate a reload. Firefly and Headstone are neat, though you'll find yourself activating them far less frequently than you'd think - LMGs don't shine in their precision capabilities." tags:pve|tags:pve

For PvE, you're looking for consistent damage uptime, high Handling (always important for Champion content), and ways to bolster your abilities. Smite does all of this quite well. I'd be looking at Demo/Gutshot for high-level (Vorpal if Anti-Barrier Pulse is a thing), Demo/Adrenaline for low-level content, and Firefly just for the fun factor. Stats for All / One for All IS good, I just tend not to recommend it on Primary weapons that typically deal with one target at a time, unlike Heavies sporting the ability to really snowball kills." tags:pve|tags:pve

Not quite the bullet hoses of the 450s, a little less fatiguing on the finger than the 360s, and feel better than the 260s for me. In PvE I really would not take a sidearm into any serious activities. They just do not have the damage or the range you would want to make them feel as effective. To make this sidearm feel as good as possible I would recommend bumping up the handling and stability. Sure you will not be able to shoot as far, but you are using a sidearm. Be real here.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Doom of Chelchis is probably the best void scout rifle we have seen in a while. Firefly and dragonfly is a hilarious combo, but another great combo is frenzy and explosive payload. Frenzy bumps up your reload to almost max, and explosive payload carries your damage a bit further. Another fun combo is explosive payload and one for all for easier activations. Vorpal in the third column also means you can get some insane damage combinations with one for all or focused fury. Definitely keep an eye out for this weapon.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Scout Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

// Out of Bounds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “The newest crucible weapon is only the slightest bit a disappointment for me. it is an Omolon 900 without phase mag. If you were not around in d2y1 or missed getting a good Stochastic Variable in Season of the Splicer, phase mag is a special Omolon magazine that drops the rpm from 900 (lightweight) to 600 (precision), and increases the damage profile to match the precision frames. The smg keeps its other stats, and retains the lightweight profile, but just hits like a precision frame. Not having that on an Omolon smg just feels wrong. Especially when it is not going to be better than regular lightweights or precision frame smgs. I digress. In most activities you will either have on Funnelweb or CALUS-Mini Tool. Out of Bounds acts as an arc alternative. With how good some arc 3.0 ability cycling is, you can almost guarantee two stacks of golden tricorn. Paired with subsistence to really tear down hordes of enemies. Out of Bounds is not going to be the best, and getting one is going to take some time. But it might just be one of the best arc weapons to use with the new subclasses.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Arc Submachine Gun Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

With both Crimil's Dagger and Steady Hand being removed from the Iron Banner loot pool there really is only Loud Lullaby in the kinetic slot. Pure Poetry is not the best option, but it is nice to have it. The best benefit over Loud Lullaby is when you get a few resets in for your vanguard rep and have multiple perks within each column. For PvE outlaw is going to be your best friend. It can allow you to completely ignore reload and invest into handling or stability for your preference. Another great option is the newly buffed ambitious assassin to also circumvent the low mag / low reload speed. In the fourth column you cannot go wrong with any number of damage perks. Frenzy, rampage, harmony, focused fury, multikill clip, or the new pugilist.

Focused fury paired with rapid hit would be an incredible combo on a primary, if Yesteryear would have gotten that combo it would be the only pulse rifle in the game with those two perks at the same time. Ambitious assassin with multikill clip is an extremely fun combination of increasing the magazine as well as increasing your damage at the same time.“ (Year 5 S18: Season of Plunder Void Pulse Rifle Primary Ammo)|tags:PvE, Controller, M+KB

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE Controller \ M+KB): Recommended MW: Reload “Did someone say energy Fatebringer? I think so. While it is great to cross compare weapons like that, all it does is allow for loadout diversity. Neither is “superior” because realistically you will not be making the choice of Fatebringer vs Zaouli's Bane, you will have your special weapon combination as well to consider. Want to use Izanagi's Burden or Arbalest? cannot use Fatebringer, the choice has been made for you.

//notes:WarlockMaggie (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "This Stasis weapon brings us solid perks like Headstone or Demolitionist. Stats for All plus Headstone is ridiculously fun. A quick warning. the intrinsic trait will make reload-based perks (like MKC and Tunnel Vision) near useless in team activities. For magazine options, choose getting more shots or increasing Stability/Reload, either or both will help combat common Aggressive frame issues. Barrels are similar: focusing on Stability and Handling over Range will make this gun feel much better in combat." Recommended MW: Reload or Stability|tags:pve,mkb,controller

Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Tactical Mag or Appended Mag plus the Backup Mag mod, to help with the origin trait boost. Then shape your own solar Fatebringer with Explosive Payload in the first trait slot which, adds flinch and damage, and is useful to disrupt Overload Champions with a matching mod, and Firefly (which should have the spec mod effects rolled in soon by Bungie) in the second.

The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag (with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery). You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep (and have more ammo in reserve) to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for Arc 3.0 builds in end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Any Battery with Backup Mag pushes you up to eight shots in the battery, so why not take advantage of a shorter charge time from Accelerated Coils? Further build into the faster charge time for burst damage against Majors with Cornered, in the first trait column. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to 13 shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. Golden Tricorn x2 boosts damage by 50% for 10s, to melt Majors and the occasional Boss (maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too). Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-God, PvE-Boss, PvE-MajorSpec, PvE-EndGame, Controller, MKB

// Fixed Odds
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): " the nature and rpm of the high-impact frame machine guns makes them feel so slow. To make Fixed Odds feel a little less slow, run either arrowhead brake for the recoil direction or fluted barrel to bring up one of its worst stats. Any mag boosting perk is preferred in the second column. Feeding frenzy or field prep will depend on how you play, but both bring up another low stat. Finally depending on how you play, killing tally, firing line, or incandescent are all fantastic perks. If you’re using a Solar 3.0 subclass, incandescent and feeding frenzy make a great pairing. If you prefer any other subclass and are solo, killing tally will be phenomenal. Finally if you run group activities a lot, firing line and field prep will be excellent for boss or major dps."

Firing line, frenzy, and vorpal are all really close in terms of best in slot, but I would rank them in that order. Firing line is the easiest to proc, frenzy can be your whole loadout, and vorpal while the weakest is still 10% damage. Depending on how you decide to play will determine which is best for you."

// Firefright
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Firefright is one of the better precision frame auto rifles we have gotten recently. Through a combination of a mag increasing perk and bonus damage of your choice you’ll have a wonderful time shooting this auto. It’s stats might mislead you, but overall I think Firefright is an excellent choice for a good all-around auto." Recommended MW - Reload.|tags:pve,mkb,controller

// Without Remorse
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "Without Remorse is an interesting shotgun. It competes with everyone’s favorite Seventh Seraph CQC-12. Without Remorse has better range and stability, but worse handling and reload. They are very comparable though, only being a maximum of 9 points off in stability. Where Without Remorse wins is in the PvE category. One-Two Punch is my favorite damage perk regardless of what subclass you play on. Having a 200% damage increase to your non-ranged melee is incredibly fun for destroying majors or chunky red bars. Pair that with auto-loading holster to keep your mag topped off is the way to go."

// (Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake), Enhanced Battery, Clown Cartridge, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 19. PvE first choice roll for boss damage in a fireteam. Bitterspite origin trait is excellent - faster reload is always useful. This is our first aggressive frame linear fusion rifle, is a fantastic legendary boss damage weapon. You can use Fluted Barrel to boost Handling and Stability or Arrowhead Brake to straight up the Recoil Direction. Enhanced Battery gives you seven shots, boosted by up to 50% with Clown Cartridge, and then Firing Line boosts damage when you're close to the other fire members. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Stability, with a Backup Mag mod to boost the magazine size to 8 - a possible 12 with Clown Cartridge.|tags:pve

Barrel Shroud helps handling (and stability), and either Assault Mag for the improved rate-of-fire or Tactical Mag for an extra shot and faster reload are probably your best choices for barrel and mag.

// Sweet Sorrow
//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "It’s almost a better Chroma Rush for majors while still having good utility in general content. This allows you to expand your loadouts and flex into kinetic (or stasis) special weapons while still having that good bullet hose in your back pocket. You seriously need to clean up the recoil direction so I think arrowhead brake is a must-have on any Sweet Sorrow you do end up keeping.

//notes:pandapaxxy (PvE / M+KB / Controller): "I think it’s leaps and bounds better than Survivor’s Epitaph but still not as good as our old and faithful Trust. With access to rapid hit and kill clip on a shallower loot pool than Survivor’s Epitaph you just have better luck getting one to drop. That roll will serve you well in all facets of the game where a 180 hand cannon isn’t an active detriment (I won’t yell at you in a raid for using it, but I cannot vouch for everyone).

// Duty Bound (Adept) (PvE first choice roll)
//notes:Inspired by DMB Player Versus Enemies Podcast 11. PvE first choice roll for general content. Not too much to offer over other kinetic adaptive auto-rifles like Scathelocke or The Last Breath, other the the origin traits. Recoil Direction and stability both need some attention, so Arrowhead Brake and a stability mag perk help. There are traits that boost stats (including reload speed) or effective mag size and in non-endgame activities, Rampage is always reliable.

// Corrective Measure - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload/Range] "One of the coolest, best-shadering Hand Cannons in the franchise, that's thoroughly under-appreciated due to a fairly stale PvE meta for 180RPMs lacking explosive ammunition. Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu. I think if 180s were given a chance to shine (outside of seasons where they're an Overload damage type), the IKELOS_HC would see some great success." tags:pve

// Sola's Scar - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Sola's is one of two Legendary Caster Frames, and the only one of the two that matters. Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker. Either way, Chain Reaction's fun, Frenzy's strong, Vorpal is a good backup." tags:pve

Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% (unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo), and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:god-pve

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

In general, for PvE you likely want to pin down an Explosive Head roll, Elastic String (Polymer or Flexible as 2nd choice), and just invest into getting Draw Time and Reload as far down as you can.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Handling] "As of the time of writing, this is the only Rocket in the game to have access to the Holy Trinity; Auto-Loading Holster, Lasting Impression, and intrinsic Tracking. Outside of that, you have an incredible perk pool, boasting Clown Cartridge (Gjally's best DPS friend), Impulse Amplifier and Field Prep. It's heartbreakingly poor to farm for, however, as I'm roughly 2000 Strikes in since its introduction, with not really anything to show for it.

I've kept the perk pool incredibly small on this wish list entry, so if you have this roll, I believe it to be the only one worth keeping (over other options). This is a general use ad-clear, soft-DPS option, and its a lot of fun. Run Spike for DPS on LARGE TARGETS (+50% Impact damage), and Proximity everywhere else. Heavy Grenade Launchers are inaccurate - Proxim makes up for this." tags:god-pve

// Posterity - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Posterity's probably one of my favourite designs ever, along with all of the DSC weapons really. It has great access to the core basics; reloaders, along with stability and damage buffs. I typically like One-for-All over Rampage here, the buff longevity feels much better on a weaker weapon like a 180RPM, as Rampage becomes difficult to chain (within 3s) in mid-to-high level content. Similarly, Rapid Hit works a treat over Feeding Frenzy once you start dealing with more resistant enemies." tags:pve

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH (which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code).

It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output (Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff), Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency...

// Fel Taradiddle - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Accuracy with Elastic] "Fel Taradiddle is a great-feeling Bow to directly compete with Whispering Slab. As a Craftable, you can fine-tune it to be as strong as possible, which I believe to be (Elastic String, Compact for Reload or Straight Fletching for Accuracy, with an Accuracy MW). You have access to Archer's, Perpetual and Killing Wind depending on playstyle, and Explosive/Successful and Adrenaline Junkie. Whereas I believe Whispering Slab's Swashbuckler to be a stronger perk for Bows (with AJ having more grenade synergy on Energy weapons), the damage perk does not go unnoticed. Fel feels great, and it's definitely worth having one in your back pocket." tags:pve

// Forensic Nightmare - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Forensic Nightmare feels great, looks great, and has some stellar perk options. It's primary issue, however, lies in its 13 Zoom stat, which effectively castrates the gun. With a (base) max damage falloff of 15m, comparing to Shayura's 17 Zoom, 21.3m damage falloff... It's incredibly noticeable. There's some issues with muzzle flash here in darker areas too. Ultimately, I'd rely on the great perks Forensic has access to, and use it more casually. A shame that the Zoom stat neuters this gun, as even the Friction Fire has 16 for the exact same frame." tags:pve

A little cooler is Grave Robber's synergy on Glaives, with the Glaive melee fully reloading the magazine and nullifying any need to invest in reload perks. Swashbuckler currently only boosts the projectile damage, but the projectiles are a larger part of the Glaive identity we haven't fully realised yet.

// Krait - [YeezyGT's WQ] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range / Stability] "Krait is pretty nuts. Overflow or Subsistence combo'd with the Veist Stinger origin allows you to shoot for... a very long time.

A PvE Insidious can have a one-of-a-kind (non-sunset) combo in Dragonfly/Rampage, though you're no longer benefitting from something like Rapid Hit / Heating Up, which are usually fixing your reload/recoil direction issues. Vorpal shreds Supers on this archetype, Demo/Adrenaline still rocks, Rapid Hit is perfect for 4-burst Pulses (and you feel the stability change mid-burst too) - there's a lot to love here, you've just gotta get the stars to align." tags:pve

With Enhanced Overflow, Extended Mag and Backup Mag, it maxes out at 17(!) in the mag, when paired with Font of Might, goes toe-to-toe with Izanagi's Burden. It's a bit more difficult to optimise swaps, but frees up the Exotic slot. Firing Line is the obvious option, though Focused Fury has a pretty low activation requirement, and allows you to use it solo / separate from teammates.

Unrelenting pairs naturally here, along with fast reloader perks like Threat Detector / Feeding Frenzy / Frenzy.

// Corrective Measure - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Honestly, there's a lot going for this gun in a 20% Vorpal buff, Rampage, Triple Tap, Subsistence, and even Threat Detector -- on top of that, Warmind Cell creation is still very much on the menu. I think if 180s were given a chance to shine (outside of seasons where they're an Overload damage type), the IKELOS_HC would see some great success." tags:pve

// Sola's Scar - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Sola's is one of two Legendary Caster Frames, and the only one of the two that matters. Whereas Temptation's Hook (S11) has 46 Impact (considerably less than every other Sword), seemingly intrinsic to being a Caster Frame - Sola's has the regular 60, making it objectively stronger. It makes you wonder whether this was intentional to give the Trials Sword significance, or they forgot that Caster Frames are supposed to be weaker. Either way, Chain Reaction's fun, Frenzy's strong, Vorpal is a good backup." tags:pve

High-Impact Reserves are good on paper, but having tried it, it doesn't trigger enough in practice simply due to how good Reconstruction is." tags:pve

Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% (unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo), and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:god-pve

// Cold Front - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Cold Front's direct competition comes in the form of Extraordinary Rendition, with a better stat package, and the S-Tier SMG perk: Frenzy, which allows it to never worry about Reload Speed (+50!). Cold Front cannot roll with this, and its base Reload is pretty paltry. You need to stack (FlaredMagwell/Reload MW/Perpetual x2) on Cold Front only to still fall 10 Reload behind Extraordinary with nothing but Frenzy. The other option here is to run Surplus, which, if you're able to maintain 3 active abilities (difficult post-ability changes), then you'll match the Frenzy buff, but be sacrificing a slot where you would have had Subsistence. Cold Front's main edge is that it rolls with S+ Tier perk Surrounded (only 750RPM in-slot that can), but I really believe you'd have to force yourself to run an SMG Reload mod to be happy with it over Rendition. Or if you just prefer the gun, which... makes sense as well." tags:pve

In general, for PvE you likely want to pin down an Explosive Head roll, Elastic String (Polymer or Flexible as 2nd choice), and just invest into getting Draw Time and Reload as far down as you can.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:god-pve

Full Court is great in (specific) circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m(!) away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Handling] "As of the time of writing, this is the only Rocket in the game to have access to the Holy Trinity; Auto-Loading Holster, Lasting Impression, and intrinsic Tracking. Outside of that, you have an incredible perk pool, boasting Clown Cartridge (Gjally's best DPS friend), Impulse Amplifier and Field Prep. It's heartbreakingly poor to farm for, however, as I'm roughly 2000 Strikes in since its introduction, with not really anything to show for it.

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "The main differentiator for Blast Battue is being able to run Clown Cartridge / Chain Reaction. I've kept the perk pool incredibly small on this wish list entry, so if you have this roll, I believe it to be the only one worth keeping (over other options). This is a general use ad-clear, soft-DPS option, and its a lot of fun. Run Spike for DPS on LARGE TARGETS (+50% Impact damage), and Proximity everywhere else. Heavy Grenade Launchers are inaccurate - Proxim makes up for this." tags:god-pve

// Posterity - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Posterity's probably one of my favourite designs ever, along with all of the DSC weapons really. It has great access to the core basics; reloaders, along with stability and damage buffs. I typically like One-for-All over Rampage here, the buff longevity feels much better on a weaker weapon like a 180RPM, as Rampage becomes difficult to chain (within 3s) in mid-to-high level content. Similarly, Rapid Hit works a treat over Feeding Frenzy once you start dealing with more resistant enemies." tags:pve

// Corrective Measure (Timelost) - [YeezyGT's S16] (pve)
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Corrective Measure suffers from "its not Commemoration" Syndrome. They're both Void 450RPM LMGs that come from farmable Raids. Both have damage perks, or explosions on precision kills. One has a way to auto-reload (even while using, that can overfill to 150 in the mag), and the other does not. I believe the main edge Corrective Measure can have is simply in the Adept's ability to run Adept Big Ones Spec, which doesn't feel like a fair trade-off. Rewind Rounds could stand for a Subsistence-esque rework, as it doesn't feel feasible to reach the end of the mag in an LMG that often." tags:pve

Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH (which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code).

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Velocity] "So, it took me 250 Overrides to collect the rolls I wanted for this, like Thanos with the Infinity Stones. Generally; [Quick/Hard Launch / Spike/Blinding / Surplush/Slideshot/Ambitious / Vorpal/Demolitionist/Frenzy]. Ultimately, this is a fantastic gun, and the rolls are mostly personal preference. There's a lot of fuss over Slideshot, but you may ultimately decide it doesn't fit your playstyle - my personal recommendation is Surplus, as it feels a lot better to get into the reload-shoot rhythm to me. Slideshot for PvP, however."|tags:god-pve,god-pvp

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Stability / Range] "Scathelocke returns from its sunsetting slumber with a clear goal in mind - fill the near-empty space where 600RPM Kinetic ARs should have been for the last 280 days.

Both Scathelocke and The Last Breath suffer from "Year 1 Syndrome", being weapons that kick like a mule. Arrowhead Brake transforms the gun, giving it a better 90 recoil direction, and its new perk combinations rock -- you'll want Subsistence/Rampage to mow down waves of adds, something that was noticeably lacking from The Forward Path."|tags:pve

Not only does it deal the extra 5% vs. shields due to its Elemental typing, it maintains the full Kinetic damage coding. In short, it is 5% stronger than every other 180RPM in PvE, blow-for-blow. As for stats, the Reload is a tad sluggish - invest into it, or rely on an Outlaw roll. Explosive Payload is always an S-Tier option, though seems to break Outlaw's registration sometimes - Headstone works as a kind of Stasis-crystal Dragonfly, which just feels great.

Best used within its own Dragonfly niche, you'll want something to bolster its Reload Speed, or, if on console, address its (not great) Stability. Those come in the forms of Subsistence, Feeding Frenzy, and Dynamic Sway Reduction. Outside of those, fight your instincts and value Stability/Reload over Range -- I'd even consider Steady Rounds of all things. Great SMG, but it makes you work for its potential."|tags:pve

If you ever wanted to feel what it was like to be Hawkeye, having those with a low Draw Time / Reload Speed will be the closest you will ever get. Outside of those rolls, Rangefinder acts like Impulse Amplifier's little brother, and Explosive Head is always fantastic in general, but specifically for Overload Champions. You can also combo Archer's Tempo + Explosive Head on this bow, which Biting Winds sadly cannot."|tags:pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE): [MW: Handling / Stability] "Don't ever let me see you manually reloading an LMG. Stack up Reconstruction with a mag extender, and you've a match made in heaven. Rampage absolutely mows through enemies, Dragonfly if you want a little more flavour. The beauty of this LMG is how stable it is -- invest in Handling and Stability and you're onto a winner. Very Hammerhead-esque, but in a much nicer form factor."|tags:god-pve

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] (PvE/PvP): [MW: Velocity] "God, this thing rocks. Not only does the little burst of flame on the explosion feel cool, the perk pool on it has insane potential. As always, Quick/Hard Launch, Spike (+30% dmg) or Blinding (utility). If you roll Auto-Loading Holster, congratulations. If not, Surplus is very good - and Quickdraw is fantastic for PvP / clutching with Blinding Grenades in GMs. Disruption Break is fantastic in PvP (if you want to be that guy), but a bit more situational for PvE. If you wanted Demolitionist here, I'd probably redirect you to Our Lord and Savior Salvager's Salvo."|tags:god-pve,pvp

// Breachlight
//notes:Mercules904 (pretty good) - "A decent, easy to use sidearm that's very comparable stat-wise (almost across the board) to Smuggler's Word. I personally like to try to max out stability on these sidearms, being that I'm a console player and it's one of the archetypes defining weakness."

// False Promises
//notes: (PvE): Mercules904 (pretty good PvE) - "What a great gun! I've been waiting for a Legendary High-Impact AR that felt like SUROS Regime with Dual Speed Receiver, and I think we've finally found one. Stat-wise it suffers from most of the same drawbacks that the other high impacts do, poor stability, low aim assist and handling, but for some reason the return to center speed of the reticle is much faster than I'm used to on the others guns in the archetype (like Halfdan) and so the low stability doesn't seem to have much of an effect of the usability of the weapon."|tags:pve

// Whispering Slab
//notes: (PvE): Mercules904 (OK PvE) - "A slightly faster draw time does not make up for how much less damage they do, which makes them harder to use in both PvP and PvE (even with the 10% damage buff to red bars from the most recent sandbox patch). They're less likely to kill injured enemies in PvP, and their accuracy (which is basically the range stat for bows) is really atrocious which means you're a lot more likely to find enemies outside of your optimal engagement range than if you use a Precision bow, Trinity Ghoul, or Le Monarque. That being said, they do have some benefits to them statistically, like high aim assist within their optimal range and a snappy feeling thanks to quick reload speed and handling."|tags:pve
