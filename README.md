# DIM Wishlist Splitter

Creates wishlists from DIM's default wishlist, Voltron, using roll descriptions and tags, including input, gamemode, author, roll type (god or backup), perk (showing only 3rd and 4th columns), and frequency (appearing at least twice).

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs: https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources

Collects 3rd and 4th column perks and origin traits from Destiny Data Explorer: https://data.destinysets.com

#### Filter Descriptions

#### Adding a Wishlist to DIM

DIM needs the URL for the raw version of a wishlist file. There are two ways to get this URL:

- Visit the GitHub Pages: https://2pillows.github.io/dim_wishlist_splitter

- Copy from the repository: https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/tree/main/wishlists

  After finding the wishlist, click "View raw" to get the raw URL.

#### Requesting a Wishlist

Create an issue using the Wishlist Request template, edit the template to configure the wishlist.

If you want a filter that isn't on the Wishlist Request template, create an issue using the Filter Request template.
