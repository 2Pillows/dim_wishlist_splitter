#### Adding a Wishlist to DIM

DIM needs the URL for the raw version of a wishlist file. There are two ways to get this URL:

- Visit the GitHub Pages: https://2pillows.github.io/dim_wishlist_splitter

- Copy from the repository: https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/tree/main/wishlists

  After finding the wishlist, click "View raw" to get the raw URL.

#### Requesting a Wishlist

Create an issue using the Wishlist Request template, edit the template to configure the wishlist.

If you want a filter that isn't in the Wishlist Request template, create an issue using the Filter Request template.
