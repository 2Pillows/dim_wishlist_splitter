# DIM Wishlist Splitter

Breaks down DIM's default wishlist, Voltron, based on the type of rolls such as PvE, PvP, PvE + Controller, etc.

Uses the voltron.txt file from dim-wish-list-sources by 48klocs (https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources).

Collects origin traits from Destiny Data Explorer (https://data.destinysets.com/).

#### Requesting a Wishlist

Create an issue using the Wishlist Request template. Edit the template to configure your desired wishlist. 

All available filter options are on the template. If a filter option is not on the template, create an issue using the Filter Request template.

#### Adding a Wishlist to DIM

DIM needs the URL for the raw version of a wishlist file. There are two ways to get the URL:

   - Visit the GitHub Pages: https://2pillows.github.io/dim_wishlist_splitter/.
   
   - Copy from the repository: https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/tree/main/wishlists.

        After finding the desired wishlist, click "View raw" to get the raw URL.
