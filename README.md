# DIM Wishlist Splitter

Creates filtered wishlists from DIM's default wishlist, Voltron, using roll descriptions and tags.

Automatically checks sources for updates every 6 hours.

### Sources

- **Wishlist Rolls**: `voltron.txt` from [dim-wish-list-sources](https://github.com/48klocs/dim-wish-list-sources) by 48klocs.

- **Perks and Traits**: 3rd and 4th column perks and origin traits from [Destiny Data Explorer](https://data.destinysets.com).

### Filter Details

For more information on filters and how they work, refer to the wishlist [README](https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/blob/main/wishlists/README.md).

### Adding a Wishlist to DIM

DIM needs the URL for the raw version of the wishlist file. There are two ways to get this URL:

- Visit the [GitHub Pages](https://2pillows.github.io/dim_wishlist_splitter).

- Go to [/wishlists](https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/tree/main/wishlists), find the wishlist, and click `View Raw`.

### Requesting a Wishlist

Create an issue using the [Wishlist Request](https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=wishlist-request.md&title=Wishlist+Request) template.

### Requesting a Filter

If you need a filter that isn't in the Wishlist Request template, create an issue using the [Filter Request](https://github.com/2Pillows/dim_wishlist_splitter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=filter-request.md&title=Filter+Request) template.
